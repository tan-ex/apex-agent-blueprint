# Development Container for APEX

> **[Version](../VERSION.md)**

This devcontainer provides a **complete, pre-configured development environment** for APEX.
It includes all required tools, extensions, and configurations to build Azure infrastructure
with AI agents.

**Base image:** `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu26.04` (`amd64` and `arm64`)

## What's Included

### Devcontainer Features (installed via `devcontainer.json`)

| Feature                   | Version | Purpose                           |
| ------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| Azure CLI                 | latest  | Azure management with Bicep CLI   |
| PowerShell                | latest  | Scripting and Az module host      |
| Python                    | 3.14    | Diagrams and tooling              |
| Node.js                   | LTS     | Validation scripts, npm tooling   |
| GitHub CLI                | latest  | Repository operations             |
| Terraform                 | latest  | Signed HashiCorp APT repository    |
| Azure Developer CLI (azd) | latest  | Standardized Azure deployments    |

### Tools Installed by `post-create.sh`

| Step | Setup                          | Method                                                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Mounted directories            | Ensure uv, gh config, and Terraform cache directories are writable |
| 2    | npm and workspace dependencies | Ensure npm 12.0.2, then `npm ci` from `package-lock.json`       |
| 3    | Python and apex-recall         | One `uv pip install` for requirements and editable recall; import and CLI verification |
| 4    | PowerShell Az modules          | Synchronous `Install-Module`, then verify each required module exists |
| 5    | Build tools and Terraform      | Check gitleaks, uv, and Terraform versions                     |
| 6    | Azure CLI and Bicep            | Stable extension auto-install, disable CLI auto-upgrade, check Bicep with fallback install |
| 7    | MCP defaults and tool versions | Add missing defaults via JSONC edits; run tool-version validation |

Required setup errors stop the script with a nonzero exit. PowerShell installs Accounts, Resources,
Storage, Network, KeyVault, and Websites modules without bypassing publisher checks; missing modules
or installation errors fail setup. Setup does not change global Git settings or credentials.

### Build-Time Tools (installed via `Dockerfile`)

Stable APT dependencies (`ca-certificates`, `curl`, `jq`, `tar`, `gzip`, `graphviz`, `dos2unix`, and `bats`)
are installed in the image layer. uv 0.8.22 and gitleaks 8.28.0 are pinned and SHA-256 verified for
`amd64` and `arm64` using [the download manifest](download-checksums.json).
The existing tool updater does not update these pins; maintain their versions and checksums explicitly.

### MCP Servers (auto-configured in `.vscode/mcp.json`)

| Server            | Transport         | Purpose                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Azure Resource Manager MCP | http      | Retail pricing and Azure cost management         |
| GitHub MCP        | http              | Copilot-provided GitHub context                  |
| Azure MCP Server  | stdio (`npx`)      | RBAC-aware Azure context for agents              |

Setup adds only missing default server entries. It preserves JSONC comments, custom arguments,
existing defaults, and custom or retired server entries. Malformed configuration fails setup and
is left untouched; setup does not perform automatic server migrations.

#### Azure MCP Runtime And Release Checks

Azure MCP uses an exact stable npm package version in the JSON configuration, with no editor-extension dependency.
The npm `latest` tag may point to a prerelease; it is not a stable-channel guarantee.
The server entry sets `NPM_CONFIG_ALLOW_REMOTE=all` for that child process only because npm 12 otherwise
rejects cross-host tarball URLs returned by the configured package feed. This permits any remote dependency URL
within that process, not a hostname allowlist. It does not change the registry or global npm settings.

`post-start.sh` runs the release check automatically on every container start, including the start after a rebuild.
It prints the result in the Dev Containers startup output. The registry request has a 30-second timeout;
outdated, offline, timeout or missing-dependency results produce a warning without blocking container startup.
No package installation, configuration rewrite, automatic upgrade or MCP restart happens in this hook.
An editor-window reload alone is not a container start. For a long-running container or to retry a warning, run:

```bash
npm run check:mcp-release
```

This read-only check queries the configured feed, selects the highest stable semantic version, and compares it
with both the workspace pin and the defaults in `configure-mcp.mjs`. It exits nonzero when an update is needed,
the pins differ, the package is not exactly pinned to a stable release, or metadata cannot be verified.
Feed lag remains possible; `CURRENT` means current according to that registry, not proof of upstream completeness.
The existing Weekly Maintenance workflow runs the same check on schedule and manual dispatch after publication
to the default branch. Monitor failed workflow notifications; it neither opens nor merges upgrade PRs automatically.

| Owner | When | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dev Containers `postStartCommand` | Every container start | Automatic advisory check; warnings keep the container usable |
| GitHub Actions Weekly Maintenance | Monday 06:00 UTC or manual dispatch | Failing job on outdated or unverifiable pins |
| Maintainer | After a warning or failed maintenance job | Review and validate the upgrade, then restart the MCP server |

For an upgrade, review release notes, update the package pin in `.vscode/mcp.json` and `configure-mcp.mjs` together,
then run `node --test tools/tests/scripts/test_devcontainer_setup.mjs` and `npm run lint:mcp-config`.
Restart Azure MCP from VS Code's `MCP: List Servers` command. Verify the reported runtime version, MCP initialization
and tool discovery before resuming APEX. Downloaded updates do not replace an already-running server.
Keep the previous pin available for rollback; do not auto-promote a beta or silently change versions during a workflow.

### VS Code Extensions

- **GitHub Copilot** — Copilot Chat
- **Python** — IntelliSense (Pylance), linting, debugging
- **Azure** — Bicep and Resource Groups explorer; Azure CLI and azd remain container tools
- **PowerShell** — language support
- **Markdown** — Native VS Code editing with Prettier formatting
- **GitHub** — Actions, Pull Requests
- **Terraform** — HashiCorp Terraform
- **Other** — YAML

#### Lean Extension Policy

Azure MCP runs directly from [the workspace MCP configuration](../.vscode/mcp.json), not an editor extension.
Keep GitHub Copilot Chat; GitHub Copilot for Azure is a separate, unwanted extension for this workflow.
The Azure Tools pack and Azure MCP Server extension bundle Azure Copilot. AI Toolkit adds another agent/skill
surface and depends on that MCP extension. Avoid those packages for the lean APEX setup.

Service-specific Azure explorers, Azure testing, and CLI/azd editor extensions are optional interfaces,
not prerequisites for the installed command-line tools. Removing them does not remove Azure CLI, azd,
Terraform, PowerShell, or the configured MCP servers. Keep the .NET runtime required by Bicep and the
Python debugger/environment tooling when using Python development features.

Workspace `unwantedRecommendations` discourage installation; they do not uninstall existing extensions
or override personal Settings Sync. The devcontainer also uses `-publisher.extension` entries to remove
the unwanted packages from the automatic container install list. `npm run validate:extension-bloat`
requires those exclusions and rejects direct additions, including version-pinned entries.
These exclusions are not an extension security policy and do not block manual or dependency-driven installs.

For an existing container, uninstall GitHub Copilot for Azure and AI Toolkit before uninstalling Azure MCP Server.
Remove the Azure Tools pack as well, retaining unrelated service explorers when offered the choice.
Reload the VS Code window, then use `MCP: List Servers` to verify that only the workspace Azure MCP provider remains.
Keep Azure Resource Manager MCP and Bicep MCP; they provide different capabilities.
If packages return, check the host/profile extensions and `dev.containers.defaultExtensions` for the Azure Tools pack
or its dependencies. Rebuild the container to apply changed devcontainer exclusions.
The extension validator guards repository declarations, not personal installations.

#### Further Setup Optimization

| Area | Implemented State / Remaining Work |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- |
| Required dependencies | Fail-fast npm, Python, and synchronous PowerShell setup |
| Python installation | Shared requirements and editable recall install, followed by verification |
| MCP configuration | Missing-default-only JSONC edits; existing entries preserved; malformed input fails untouched |
| Image layers | Stable APT dependencies and checksum-verified uv/gitleaks installed at build time |
| Cache persistence | Terraform provider volume added; uv volume retained |
| Additional caches | No new npm or PowerShell module volumes: measured value and portability remain unproven |
| Git authentication | Existing credentials preserved; optional token forwarding uses the VS Code host process |
| Validation and timing | Actual image build and cold/warm timing remain unverified; Docker/devcontainer executables unavailable in the validation environment |

Startup performs a bounded, read-only MCP release query; `post-start.sh` does no installs or upgrades.
No extension-removal token savings or rebuild-time improvement is claimed without measurements.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** installed and running
- **VS Code** with **Dev Containers** extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`)
- **4 GB RAM** minimum allocated to Docker
- **10 GB disk space** for container image and tools

### Opening the Devcontainer

**Option 1: Command Palette** (recommended)

1. Open VS Code in this repository folder
2. Press `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`
3. Type and select: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
4. Wait for the image build and post-create setup to finish; cold-build time depends on downloads and host resources

**Option 2: Notification Prompt**

1. Open VS Code in this repository folder
2. Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted

### First-Time Setup (inside container)

```bash
# 1. Authenticate with Azure
az login

# 2. Set your default subscription
az account set --subscription "<your-subscription-id>"

# 3. Start working
# Open Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I) → Select Orchestrator → Describe your project
```

## GitHub Authentication

Git normally uses credentials forwarded by VS Code Dev Containers from the host credential helper
or SSH agent. Git and the `gh` CLI can use different identities; successful Git access does not
establish a `gh` login.

For `gh`, use an explicitly authenticated configuration in the persistent `~/.config/gh` Docker
volume, or an optional host-process `GH_TOKEN`. If authentication is needed, the user chooses and
performs it, for example with `gh auth login`. Setup and agents must not run login automatically,
switch credentials, or persist Git credential-helper changes.

### Optional Host-Process Token

`remoteEnv.GH_TOKEN` uses `${localEnv:GH_TOKEN}`: the environment inherited by the **host VS Code process**
when it launches. Supply a token securely in that host environment before launching VS Code; an already
running VS Code process may need a full exit and relaunch before reopening the container.
After rotation, refresh that host environment and relaunch VS Code so the container receives the new value.

`terminal.integrated.env.*` applies only to integrated terminals. It does not populate `${localEnv:GH_TOKEN}`
and does not make a token available to all lifecycle hooks, MCP processes, or the extension host.
An export inside the container likewise does not change the host VS Code environment.

A fine-grained PAT is optional, not the only supported authentication method. Limit its repository access,
permissions, and lifetime to the intended operations; organization policies or approval may also apply.
An environment token takes precedence over stored `gh` credentials. Never put secrets in repository files,
paste them into chat, or ask an agent to receive or display them.

### Identity Mismatch on Git Push

When Git reports permission denied to an unexpected account, compare that identity with the CLI identity:

```bash
gh api user --jq .login
```

Check the target repository and branch as well. Do not automatically switch accounts or change persistent
Git configuration. If the user confirms the `gh` identity is the intended account and explicitly authorizes
using it for this push, use a per-command helper for the approved feature branch:

```bash
git -c credential.helper= -c credential.helper='!gh auth git-credential' push origin <approved-feature-branch>
```

Replace the branch placeholder before running. The empty helper clears inherited helpers for this invocation;
single quotes protect `!` from Bash history expansion. This does not change saved Git settings or authorize
a force push or a push to `main`. If the identities already match, investigate repository permissions or branch
protection instead of changing credentials.

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable                  | Value                         | Purpose                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AZURE_DEFAULTS_LOCATION` | `swedencentral`               | Default Azure region (EU GDPR-compliant)                 |
| `GH_TOKEN`                | `${localEnv:GH_TOKEN}`        | Optional token inherited by the host VS Code process     |
| `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE` | `1`                           | Skip `.pyc` generation                                   |
| `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`        | `1`                           | Unbuffered Python output                                 |
| `UV_CACHE_DIR`            | `~/.cache/uv`                 | uv package cache                                         |
| `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR`     | `~/.terraform.d/plugin-cache` | Terraform provider cache                                 |

### Azure CLI Extension Auto-Install

`post-create.sh` configures Azure CLI so extension-backed commands do not pause for prompts:

```bash
az config set extension.use_dynamic_install=yes_without_prompt
az config set extension.dynamic_install_allow_preview=false
```

Preview extensions remain opt-in. To auto-install preview extensions too, change
`extension.dynamic_install_allow_preview` to `true` in `~/.azure/config`.

## Lifecycle Scripts

### `onCreateCommand` — Azure CLI Smoke Check

Runs `az version --output none` once when the container is created and fails if Azure CLI is unusable.
System packages, uv, and gitleaks are already installed in the image.

### `postCreateCommand` — `post-create.sh`

Runs once after container creation. Installs workspace dependencies and PowerShell modules, adds missing
MCP defaults, and verifies tools. Required failures stop setup. Output goes to stdout/stderr in the
Dev Containers creation log (or the terminal for a manual run); no separate installation log file is written.

### `postStartCommand` — `post-start.sh`

Runs on every container start without installing or upgrading dependencies:

| Check | Method |
| --- | --- |
| Hook permissions | Restore executable bits on mounted shell hooks |
| azd authentication | Read-only status check |

### When to Rebuild vs. Restart

| Situation                       | Action                                       |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Workspace dependency setup failed | Resolve the reported error, then run `bash .devcontainer/post-create.sh` |
| Build-time tool missing or broken | Rebuild the container; post-create verifies but does not reinstall uv/gitleaks |
| New devcontainer feature needed | `F1` → Rebuild Container                     |
| OS-level or base image update   | `F1` → Rebuild Container Without Cache       |
| Dependency or tool update       | Update the relevant pins or lockfile, then rebuild the container |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                      | Solution                                                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Container won't start      | Check Docker is running; increase memory to 4 GB+        |
| Workspace dependency missing | Resolve setup errors and rerun `bash .devcontainer/post-create.sh` |
| uv or gitleaks missing     | Rebuild the image; check the build log and download manifest |
| Azure auth fails           | Use `az login --use-device-code`                         |
| `gh` CLI not authenticated | Explicitly authenticate `gh`, or supply optional host-process `GH_TOKEN` |
| Git and `gh` identities differ | Follow [Identity Mismatch on Git Push](#identity-mismatch-on-git-push) |
| Stale tool versions        | Review pins and locks before rebuilding; uv/gitleaks are not updated by the tool updater |
| Full rebuild needed        | `F1` → `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container Without Cache` |

## Resource Usage

| Metric             | Value   |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| Container image    | ~1.5 GB |
| Memory (idle)      | ~1 GB   |
| Memory (active)    | ~2-3 GB |
| Disk (with caches) | ~4-6 GB |

## Security Notes

- Azure credentials persist in the host `~/.azure/` bind mount; never commit credentials to Git
- Explicit `gh` authentication persists in its config volume; optional `GH_TOKEN` comes from the host process
- Never store tokens in repository files or send secrets through chat or model-visible tool input
- gitleaks runs as a pre-commit hook for secret scanning (soft-skips if not installed)
- Use Azure Key Vault for production secrets
- Use service principals for CI/CD environments
