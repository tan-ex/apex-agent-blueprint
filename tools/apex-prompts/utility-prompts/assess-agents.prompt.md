Produces per-agent scorecards + a ranked fleet plan. Plans only — never edits an agent in the same pass."

# 4-Layer Per-Agent Assessment → Fleet Plan

Local operational adapter. Preserve this prompt's agent, model, and tool routing.
Read [apex-agent-authoring](../../../.github/skills/apex-agent-authoring/SKILL.md), then
follow the [canonical procedure](../../../.github/skills/apex-agent-authoring/references/assess-agents.md).

Pass supplied inputs, scope, and options unchanged. Preserve the procedure's
required inputs, activities, output paths, approval gates, and bounded failures.
A reference grants no tools or model changes. Stop on unavailable prerequisites;
never silently inherit a different model, widen access, or invent success.
