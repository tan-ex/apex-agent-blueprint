# Log profiling — `profile_debug_log.py`

Profiles Copilot Chat OTel debug logs for the token-reduction
workstream. Used by `11-Context Optimizer` during audits and by the
multi-log baselining workflow under
`agent-output/_baselines/`.

## Quick start

```sh
# Plain-text summary
python3 tools/scripts/profile_debug_log.py logs/test04-01.json

# Machine-readable JSON
python3 tools/scripts/profile_debug_log.py logs/test04-01.json --json

# npm alias (parity with other repo scripts)
npm run profile:debug-log -- logs/test04-01.json
```

## What it extracts

For a discussion-only acceptance probe, use the payload-free JSON mode:

```sh
python3 tools/scripts/profile_debug_log.py tmp/probe.json --probe-evidence
```

This omits instructions, tool arguments/results and paths, records the input log's SHA-256,
and reports observed model/tool events. Invocation attribution remains unknown: timestamps alone
cannot distinguish a harness-generated todo read from a model request. Missing events do not prove
export completeness, and the tool never assigns a pass verdict. Model/tool names remain visible;
inspect the output before sharing it.

To pair separately supplied text, manually redact both files first, then add
`--reviewed-prompt tmp/prompt.txt --reviewed-response tmp/response.txt`.
Those contents are included verbatim with operator-supplied provenance, not represented as extracted
log text. Redaction and matching are not automatically verified. Keep raw exports and evidence bundles
in ignored scratch storage, never agent-discovery folders or public commits.

## Compliance thresholds

Invocation totals count attempts, including failures. Modern `runSubagent` tool spans use the recorded
`agentName`; malformed or absent arguments leave identity unknown. Linked legacy wrapper/child spans count
once using trace/parent IDs, not timing guesses. Unlinked events cannot be assumed to describe the same invocation.
Payload sizes are UTF-8 byte counts, not token counts. Cumulative input sums repeated context across observed
requests; it is not a single context-window size or an uncached bill. Missing child requests and cache/billing
fields remain unknown. Repeated reads after artifact edits are not automatically redundant.

Two informational warnings drop into the output when a session
violates a token-reduction contract — exit code stays 0.

- `--max-spans-between-clears N` (default `50`) flags any run of
  `chat:*` spans between `SessionStart`/`Stop` markers that exceeds
  `N`. Backs **Phase 2a** (Gate-boundary `/clear` handoff).
- `--max-askquestions-per-phase N` (default `3`) flags any contiguous
  run between `turn_start:N` markers that exceeds `N` askQuestions
  calls. Backs **Phase 4** (batching enforcement).

## Multi-log baselining

For the **Phase 0** baseline range, run the profiler against ≥3
sessions covering different workflow shapes and roll the JSON output
into one document:

```sh
mkdir -p agent-output/_baselines
for log in logs/test04-01.json logs/agent-debug-log-*.json tmp/agent-debug-log-*.json; do
  echo "=== ${log} ==="
  python3 tools/scripts/profile_debug_log.py "${log}" --json
done > agent-output/_baselines/profile-runs.jsonl
```

Compute p50 / p90 / max manually (or with `jq`) across the sessions
for each headline metric and save the result locally as
`agent-output/_baselines/multi-log-baseline.json` (gitignored working
data). The token-reduction plan locks targets against the **p50** of
that range, never the canonical `test04-01` outlier alone.

## Tests

`tools/tests/scripts/test_profile_debug_log.py` runs against a small
anonymised fixture (`tools/tests/fixtures/otel-log-min.json`). File paths
are replaced with `path/REDACTED`; token counts are preserved.

```sh
python3 -m pytest tools/tests/scripts/test_profile_debug_log.py -q
```

## Schema reference

VS Code Copilot Chat exports an OpenTelemetry payload:

```text
{
  "resourceSpans": [{ "scopeSpans": [{ "spans": [...] }] }],
  "copilotChat":   { "sessionId": "...", "sessionTitle": "..." }
}
```

Each span carries `name`, `startTimeUnixNano`, `endTimeUnixNano`,
`status.code` (0=UNSET/OK, 1=OK, 2=ERROR), and a typed
`attributes[]` list. Chat calls are `chat:<model>` spans; tool
invocations have `gen_ai.operation.name == "execute_tool"` with the
tool name in `gen_ai.tool.name`.
