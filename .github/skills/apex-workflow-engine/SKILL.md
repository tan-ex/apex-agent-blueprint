# Workflow Engine Skill

Provides a declarative, machine-readable workflow graph that the Orchestrator
reads instead of relying on hardcoded step logic.

## When to Use

- Orchestrator determining the next step after a gate
- Resuming a workflow via `apex-recall show <project> --json`
- Validating that all steps have proper dependencies and outputs
- Understanding fan-out (parallel sub-steps) and conditional routing

## Rules

- **Forward DAG** — `edges` must be acyclic; refinement routes are declared separately in `return_edges`.
- **Source of truth is `templates/workflow-graph.json`** — the orchestrator reads this directly; do not encode workflow logic in agent prose
- **Gates are blocking** — a `gate` node halts downstream execution until human approval is recorded in session state
- **IaC routing** — `step-4` is the shared planner; select CodeGen and Deploy nodes using `decisions.iac_tool`.
- **Fan-out is logical work structure**, not permission to invoke main agents or unavailable workers.
   The owning main agent handles its outputs; parallelize only independent, authorized work.
- **Edge conditions** — follow the graph's declared conditions, including refinement returns; the schema allows a string or array.
- **Schema evolution** — bump `metadata.version` and follow `references/schema-evolution.md` rollback rules when changing the graph

## Prerequisites

Use the graph and `apex-recall show <project> --json` together. If the returned
`session` is empty, initialize or recover the project before routing.

## Steps

Orchestrator protocol for routing the next step:

1. **Load** `templates/workflow-graph.json`
2. **Read current state** — use `session.current_step`, `session.steps`, and `session.decisions` in the response.
3. **Resolve the node** — use the per-step status map to distinguish Design (`3`) from Governance (`3_5`);
   use `decisions.iac_tool` for the CodeGen and Deploy tracks. Do not derive a node ID from the numeric pointer alone.
4. **Check node status**:
   - `complete` → follow `on_complete` edges → find next node
   - `in_progress` → resume from `sub_step` checkpoint
   - `pending` → offer the declared human handoff to the owning main agent
   - `skipped` → follow `on_skip` edges
   - failed or blocked → stop and follow the applicable declared recovery or refinement route
5. **Apply edge and node conditions** — honor optional Design selection and the IaC track;
   do not execute every outgoing edge when alternatives are present.
6. **If next is a `gate`** — check its preconditions, present to the user, wait for approval, and record the decision.
7. **If next is a `subagent-fan-out`** — use the owning agent's actual role/tool contract;
   never infer callable workers from graph children. Collect required outputs before continuing.
8. **Repeat** until all nodes are complete or blocked

## Core Concepts

Forward execution and declared refinement returns are distinct. A shared
`step-4` plan feeds `step-5b` / `step-5t`, then `step-6b` / `step-6t`.
Approval gates remain blocking on both tracks.

[`references/dag-concepts.md`](references/dag-concepts.md).

## Workflow Graph

The full machine-readable DAG is in:
`templates/workflow-graph.json`

### Reading the Graph (Orchestrator Protocol)

Use [Steps](#steps) as the routing protocol. Response fields are documented in
[`show-schema.md`](../../../tools/apex-recall/docs/show-schema.md).

## Reference Index

Operational Local and Host entrypoints share
[workflow-entry.md](references/workflow-entry.md). For parent-to-worker calls,
read [execution-subagent.md](references/execution-subagent.md).
Manual Host workflow entry uses
[apex-host-workflow-start](../apex-host-workflow-start/SKILL.md), including
`resume [project]`. This skill requires explicit owner selection; it does not bind models/tools.

Other retained Local operations load only their requested procedure:
[imported IaC](references/review-imported-iac.md),
[existing Azure as-built](references/as-built-from-azure.md),
[project review](references/project-wide-review.md).
Published documentation maintenance belongs to the separate `jonathan-vella/apex-docs` repository.
Do not load retired documentation tooling when advancing infrastructure steps.
For their shared execution boundary, read
[operational-safety.md](references/operational-safety.md).

## Validation Surfaces

The workflow graph is enforced at three points:

| Validator                                                    | Rule registry                        | Scope                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `tools/scripts/validate-workflow-graph.mjs`                  | inline                               | Graph shape + schema                          |
| `tools/scripts/validate-agents.mjs --only=workflow-handoffs` | `WORKFLOW_HANDOFF_RULES`             | `handoffs[]` UI buttons + `agents[]` dispatch |
| `tools/scripts/validate-artifacts.mjs`                       | `ARTIFACT_HEADINGS["00-handoff.md"]` | Gate-companion file H2 sync                   |

`npm run validate:_node` includes these checks. For focused graph and handoff
checks, use `npm run validate:workflow-graph` and `npm run lint:workflow-handoffs`.
Artifact Markdown validation remains owned by the existing hooks and challenger review.
