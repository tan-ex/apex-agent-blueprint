# Phase 3: Service Recommendations — runbook

Referenced by [`02-Requirements`](../../../agents/02-requirements.agent.md)
Phase 3. Externalised from the agent body to keep per-turn system-prompt
replay small (per `tmp/plan-input-token-reduction-v3.md` Phase 8).

This phase is required. Use **batched `askQuestions` calls** to gather
service-class decisions. Group questions whose options / multiSelect /
recommendations do not depend on a prior answer into a single batched call
(the `questions[]` array accepts multiple entries). Only split into separate
calls when a later question's option set or recommendation is computed from
an earlier answer (see Step 3b's `application_layers` gating below).

Required batching (saves ~10 turns per Phase 3):

- **Batch A — NFR profile** (Step 3a): service_tier, availability_target,
  recovery_profile in one call. All three are independent.
- **Batch B — Topology + compute + data** (Steps 3b–3f): combine
  compute_host, relational_db, non_relational_store, storage_needs into a
  single batched call. Conditionally include application_layers in Batch B
  if the workload pattern is N-Tier or microservices (set its
  `multiSelect: true`); otherwise omit it.
- **Batch C — Integration + platform** (Steps 3g–3h): messaging_events and
  supporting_services in one batched call. supporting_services pre-checks
  defaults (Monitor, App Insights, Log Analytics, Key Vault) plus ACR when
  a container host was selected in Batch B.
- **Confirm step** (Step 3i): one final batched call with the consolidated
  service list (`multiSelect: true`, all chosen preselected).

Use business-friendly descriptions with Azure service names in parentheses.

## 3a. NFR profile and tier

Use `askQuestions` for:

- Service tier: cost-optimized, balanced, or enterprise.
- Availability target with downtime-oriented labels.
- Recovery objective profile (single-select):
  - Relaxed: RTO 24h, RPO 12h, SLA 99.5%.
  - Standard: RTO 4h, RPO 1h, SLA 99.9%.
  - Mission-Critical: RTO 15m, RPO 5m, SLA 99.99%.
  - Custom: freeform RTO/RPO/SLA.

## 3b. Application topology

If the workload pattern is N-Tier or microservices, use `askQuestions` for
application layers with `multiSelect: true` (Presentation/Web, API,
Background worker, Batch/Job, Real-time/Events, Other). Skip when the
pattern is purely static-site or single-binding serverless and there is no
obvious layering.

## 3c. Compute host (web and API tier)

Use `askQuestions` for the primary compute host. Single-select unless the
user clarifies multiple workloads. Options include business-friendly
descriptions:

- App Service (managed web/API hosting on App Service Plan).
- Container Apps (managed container hosting with KEDA-style scaling).
- Azure Kubernetes Service (full Kubernetes platform).
- Functions (event-driven serverless).
- Static Web Apps (static frontend + APIs; pinned to `westeurope` for EU).
- Other / unsure.

Recommend the option that matches the inferred workload pattern. Avoid
recommending AKS for a small MVP team unless the user explicitly asks for
Kubernetes.

## 3d. Relational data store

Use `askQuestions` for the operational relational data store
(single-select):

- Azure SQL Database (managed SQL, Microsoft ecosystem default).
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server (open-source SQL).
- Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server (open-source SQL, LAMP-style
  apps).
- Azure SQL Managed Instance (lift-and-shift SQL Server compatibility).
- None or not needed.
- Other / unsure.

Record the answer with
`apex-recall decide <project> --key relational_db --value <choice> --json`.

## 3e. Non-relational data store

Use `askQuestions` for a non-relational data store, if any (single-select):

- Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL, multi-model).
- Azure Cache for Redis (cache layer; pair with a primary store).
- Azure Table Storage (cheap key/value, simple needs).
- None or not needed.
- Other / unsure.

## 3f. Storage and content

Use `askQuestions` for storage needs with `multiSelect: true`:

- Blob storage for media or document files.
- Azure Files (SMB share) for legacy file-share workloads.
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for analytics.
- No additional storage needed.

## 3g. Messaging and events

Use `askQuestions` for messaging/event services with `multiSelect: true`
when the workload description mentions async work, integrations, or
analytics. Otherwise ask once with a clear "None" option:

- Azure Service Bus (transactional queues/topics).
- Azure Event Hubs (high-throughput event ingestion).
- Azure Event Grid (pub/sub for cloud events).
- Azure Storage Queues (lightweight queues).
- None.

## 3h. Observability and supporting services

Use `askQuestions` for required supporting platform services with
`multiSelect: true` and pre-checked recommendations:

- Azure Monitor + Application Insights (recommended).
- Log Analytics workspace (recommended).
- Key Vault for secrets/certs (recommended).
- Azure Container Registry (only if container hosts are selected).
- Azure Front Door / Application Gateway / CDN for edge ingress.
- API Management (only when an external API surface is explicit).

## 3i. Confirm Azure services in scope

After collecting per-class answers, present a final `askQuestions` summary
list with `multiSelect: true`, preselected with all chosen services, so the
user can add or remove items before artifact generation.
