# Codegen Shared Workflow

Shared workflow phases for both Bicep and Terraform code generation agents.
Each agent reads this reference and substitutes its IaC-specific tools.

## Plan-Lock Contract (HARD GATE, applies to all phases)

After gate-3 (Plan Approval), these artifacts are **read-only** for the
CodeGen agents (06b / 06t):

- `agent-output/{project}/04-implementation-plan.md`
- `agent-output/{project}/04-governance-constraints.md`
- `agent-output/{project}/04-governance-constraints.json`

Rules:

1. **No self-edit.** CodeGen agents MUST NOT write to any frozen artifact via
   `apply_patch`, `replace_string_in_file`, `multi_replace_string_in_file`, or
   `create_file`. Apex-recall `decide` / `finding` entries are allowed (they
   write to session state, not the artifacts).
2. **No plan-level challenger.** Challenger subagents invoked from Step 5 MUST
   use `artifact_type = "iac-code"` and target `infra/{tool}/{project}/`. Do
   NOT pass `artifact_type = "implementation-plan"` from Step 5.
3. **Plan must_fix → Return to Planner.** If a code-review pass surfaces a
   finding whose root cause is in the plan (missing resource, wrong topology,
   unsatisfiable governance), STOP Step 5 and traverse the `↩ Return to
Step 4` handoff. Do not patch the plan in place.
4. **Plan readiness precondition.** Before entering Phase 1, confirm
  `apex-recall show <project> --json` shows Step 4 complete with current required
  review evidence. Use the explicitly selected, audited confirmation when present;
  preserved superseded findings are history, not current blockers. Deep-mode required
  lenses still apply. Missing/stale selected evidence or current blockers return to Planner.
  Use `session.review_selections` and `session.effective_reviews` from `apex-recall show --json` for newly persisted
  selections. Review selection does not authorize operations. Missing legacy structured selection requires explicit
  owner selection, not parsing audit prose; separately required contract and operational checks still apply.

## Phase 1: Preflight Check

For each resource in `04-iac-contract.json` (with the implementation plan as its prose mirror):

1. Verify the approved AVM module and version using the supported metadata workflow:

   - Bicep: available AVM metadata tools or the existing AVM index/resolver.
   - Terraform: public Terraform Registry API metadata for the approved exact version.

   Preserve the plan's exact module pins; failed lookup or a required version change
   returns to the Planner, not a new version selection in CodeGen.

2. Cross-check planned parameters against the module schema; flag type mismatches
3. Check region limitations
4. Save results to `agent-output/{project}/04-preflight-check.md`
5. If blockers found, use `askQuestions` to present them and collect the user's decision
   (fix and re-run, or abort and return to Planner)

### Exact inputs and AVM evidence

Read and run the explicit artifact-path commands in
[Contract Integrity Gate](contract-emission-and-handoff.md#phase-1--contract-integrity-gate-mandatory).
Before parameter checks, follow [input resolution](../../apex-azure-defaults/references/identity-resolution.md#resolve-before-asking).
Do not pass a bare project name to contract, consistency, policy-map or environment-manifest validators.
An unsupported `--help` argument is not validation; consult that command's Usage section instead of guessing flags.
Run from the verified workspace root. Reuse unchanged required guidance still in context rather than reloading skills.

Bicep module catalogs establish published pins, not parameter compatibility. Inspect the returned JSON shape before
filtering: a wrapped `modules[]` response is not a top-level array. Never substitute the latest catalog pin for the
approved version. If exact interfaces are missing, restore only approved references from an isolated temporary Bicep
manifest with authorized network access; no project module or upstream artifact need be created to restore metadata.
Do not use `--force` for healthy cached pins. Discover actual cache files before selecting the approved module/version;
do not construct escaped dollar-sign paths from memory. The cache layout is CLI-specific, not a public API.

For each upcoming module, inspect parameter types, required/defaulted fields, allowed values, nested definitions and
outputs actually used by its planned bindings. Listing `parameters | keys` verifies names only. Record that limited
evidence as such; do not claim full parameter/type compatibility until those checks pass. Schema availability does
not verify service-side deployment rules or regional capacity. Reuse inspected exact-version evidence while current.

For SQL S2 and ordinary App Service Plans, inspect concrete generated provider properties, not AVM parameter names alone.
Use `node tools/scripts/validate-provider-payload.mjs --input <resolved-resource-array> --s2-max-bytes <approved-bytes>`
on a provenance-backed extraction. Unresolved expressions are unverified, not passes. Verify the SQL byte-size against
current target-region capabilities and approved requirements; do not assume the module's 32-GiB default works for S2.
Ordinary serverfarm network properties are not application VNet integration. Do not enable custom mode or add an ASE/Web
App to repair that mismatch. Verify identity separately. Plan/manifest conflicts require one consolidated owner correction.

## Phase 1.5: Governance Compliance Mapping
### Azure Monitor reachability

For Log Analytics and Application Insights, disabled public ingestion/query flags are access restrictions, not
proof of private connectivity. Before claiming observability readiness, reconcile each required producer and query
client with the approved access path. Private querying requires an Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS),
resource associations, its private endpoint, service-correct DNS and a reachable authorized client network.
Reuse an existing shared scope only with verified ownership, associations and connectivity evidence.

If these dependencies are absent from frozen inputs, stop the affected observability readiness claim and return
the discrepancy to Planner. Do not enable public access, add AMPLS/resources or change scope/budget in CodeGen.
An explicitly approved deferred telemetry/query capability must be reported as deferred, not operationally ready.
Evaluate ingestion paths separately: service-delivered platform diagnostics and SDK/agent traffic need not have
the same network behavior. Do not infer that every ingestion path is blocked, or that successful resource creation
proves query access. Verify service-specific exceptions before relying on them.
Read-only shared-path discovery does not authorize redesign or establish tenant-wide absence. Carry the scope,
remaining unknowns and conditional capacity/cost estimates from the
[reconciliation evidence rules](contract-emission-and-handoff.md#shared-path-reconciliation-evidence) into the handoff.

### Policy mapping

Gate: do not proceed to code generation with unresolved Deny policy violations.

1. Read `04-governance-constraints.json` — extract all `Deny` policies
2. Map policy property paths to IaC-specific arguments:
   - Bicep: use `azurePropertyPath` (fall back to `bicepPropertyPath`), drop leading resource-type segment
   - Terraform: use `azurePropertyPath`, translate via the resource type mapping table in `.github/instructions/references/iac-policy-compliance.md`
3. Build compliance map: resource type → IaC property → required value
4. Merge governance tags with baseline defaults (governance wins)
5. Validate every planned resource can comply
6. If any Deny policy is unsatisfiable, use `askQuestions` to present the unresolved
   policies and collect user decision (return to Planner or override)

Policy Effect Reference: `apex-azure-defaults/references/policy-effect-decision-tree.md`

## Phase 1.6: Context Compaction

Before code generation, select runtime compression from observed context usage:

1. Summarize prior phases in a single concise message (preflight result, governance map,
   deployment strategy, resource list with module paths/sources)
2. Avoid optional or redundant reads; load missing required phase guidance before using it.
  Skills remain single-tier, with no digest/minimal variants.
3. Reuse unchanged predecessor content still available in context. After edits,
  compaction, or a new chat, refresh only the needed sections; never infer missing contract fields.
4. Update session state: `sub_step: "phase_1.6_compacted"`

## Phase 2: Output Cadence (Bounded Validated Batches)

Continue approved generation in bounded dependency-ordered batches without asking for routine next-file permission.
Use at most three new source files per batch, validate each edit before dependent work, then checkpoint the batch.
Continue the next batch in the same turn while scope, tools and context remain valid. A batch boundary is not a
human approval gate. An explicit user request for one file or an earlier stop takes precedence.
The per-tool file-order tables define dependency order, not response boundaries. No live deployment is authorized.

### Cadence per file

1. Announce on one short line: `Generating: <path> (n/total)`.
2. Use editing tools, preserving existing user work; run the focused build/shape check immediately.
3. Repair a confirmed local defect within existing caps and rerun that check. Do not move to dependent work on failure.
4. Continue automatically; stop only for an unresolved blocker, ownership/scope change, required approval or context loss.

### Build cadence (early-warning, not full validation)

After each edit, check build readiness and run the narrowest available toolchain check;
at each batch boundary and on completion run the root build
using the execution mechanism allowed by the agent's tool/subagent budget:

- Bicep: `bicep build infra/bicep/{project}/main.bicep`
- Terraform: `terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/{project} validate`

Use actual emitted-file count, not file-order table ordinals. If the entrypoint or required
local dependencies have not yet been emitted, record the check as deferred (not passed), continue
the approved dependency order, and run it as soon as the scaffold is buildable.
Provider/module initialization must be ready before Terraform validate; never infer readiness from
the existence of `.terraform/` alone. A real compile/validation failure blocks further unrelated generation
until repaired and rechecked. Per-write applicable shape checks still run, including Terraform formatting.
Perform a final build for the last partial group; no completion or handoff with deferred checks.

### Root dependency checks before deferring a build

A missing-module build cannot validate the deployment graph. Inspect root wiring against the approved dependency
contract even when the scaffold is incomplete. Module declaration order, `resourceId(...)`, and names passed to
`resourceGroup(...)` do not create deployment dependencies. In `all` mode, every RG-scoped module must wait for the
resource-group creation, and consumers must wait for network, DNS, identity and diagnostics prerequisites.
Prefer actual module outputs for implicit edges when their interfaces are verified; when using constructed IDs for
phase-safe reuse, add explicit prerequisite `dependsOn` edges. Do not serialize unrelated resources or alter scope.
Validate both `all` and separately selected phases; prerequisites omitted by a phase must already exist, not be
silently created. Check emitted ARM dependencies once the scaffold builds. Terraform follows the same ownership
graph using output references or explicit dependencies where needed, not Bicep syntax.

If an early build is attempted, defer only errors traced to known, not-yet-emitted approved module files (and their
dependent invalid references). Missing external modules, syntax/type errors and unrelated diagnostics are real
failures. Report outstanding warnings separately; never infer provider correctness from a deferred build. Preserve
the bounded validated batch cadence and continue the next approved module, not a repeat full preflight.
Missing module interfaces can mask additional semantic errors. Reclassify all diagnostics whenever a module is
added; BCP265 function shadowing and BCP134 scope mismatch are real source failures even alongside BCP091.
Use role-specific module symbols rather than names of Bicep scope functions. A mechanical repair to an existing
root after its child compiles remains in scope; validate it before the next approved dependent module.

This is in addition to — not a replacement for — the full
`bicep-validate-subagent` / `terraform-validate-subagent` runs in Phase 4.

### Resume after a length-limit abort

If a prior turn aborted with the length-limit error:

- Inspect the next file against approved inputs; existence alone does not prove a complete write.
  Preserve complete matching files. Stop for an ownership decision on unexpected user changes;
  repair a confirmed partial agent write with an editing tool before continuing.
- Preserve ambiguous lines and custom wiring until ownership is established or the
  user explicitly authorizes the specific edit. Syntax errors, validation failures
  and plan conflicts do not establish ownership or authorize deletion or replacement.
  If recovery requires changing that content, stop for clarification and keep the
  affected validation and deployment handoff blocked; never repair by discarding it.
- Resume at the next missing or confirmed incomplete file, validate it, then continue the bounded batch.
- Do **not** re-emit any file already on disk.
- Do not reconstruct lost content from memory; recover the relevant contract and continue the validated batch.
- If state is unclear, list `infra/{tool}/{project}/` first to confirm
  which files exist, then resume from the first missing entry in the
  file-order table.

### Anti-patterns (root causes of length-limit aborts)

- Emitting `main.bicep` plus 5 modules plus `azure.yaml` plus `deploy.ps1`
  in one response.
- Treating a numbered "Round" as permission to skip per-edit checks or exceed the batch bound.
- Asking for routine continuation after each file when no approval or decision is needed.
- Bundling file creation with verbose narration of all files at once
  ("Here are all the modules: ...").

## Phase 4.5: Adversarial Code Review (opt-in, default-skip)

Before final validation, finish approved parameter and deployment-support artifacts. Missing generated files are
unfinished CodeGen work, not a reason to hand a blocked package to Deploy. Resolve inputs before requesting values;
do not run the independent validator again merely because the prior successful run had untidy output or timing.

Read `apex-azure-defaults/references/adversarial-review-protocol.md` for the
lens table and invocation template.

**Default**: Phase 4.5 is skipped (`step-5b/5t.challenger.default_passes = 0`).
Opt-in triggers: `decisions.review_depth == "deep"` OR an explicit
`10-Challenger` invocation.

When opted in, follow the recommended shape from
`step-5b.challenger.opt_in_matrix` / `step-5t.challenger.opt_in_matrix` in `workflow-graph.json`
for the current `decisions.complexity`:

- `simple` → 1× `comprehensive`
- `standard` → 2 passes (`security-governance` → `architecture-reliability`)
- `complex` → 3 passes (`security-governance` → `architecture-reliability` → `cost-feasibility`)

Apply the cascade early-exit rules from
`adversarial-review-protocol.md → ## Opt-in: Deep adversarial review`.

Invoke challenger subagents with `artifact_type = "iac-code"`, rotating `review_focus` per protocol.

Write results to `challenge-findings-iac-code-pass{N}.json`.
Fix any `must_fix` items, re-validate, re-run failing pass.
Save validation status in `05-implementation-reference.md`. Artifact lint is
owned by the lefthook `artifact-validation` pre-commit hook and the
`10-Challenger` review — do not invoke `npm run lint:artifact-templates` here
(see
[`agent-authoring.instructions.md`](../../../instructions/agent-authoring.instructions.md#no-direct-markdownlint-on-agent-output-rule)).

### Batched User Decisions

When a challenger pass surfaces findings that require user input, build a
**single** `vscode_askQuestions` invocation with one question per decision —
do NOT issue sequential prompts. Pattern:

1. Group findings into decision buckets (e.g. `must_fix_A`, `must_fix_B`,
   `should_fix_C`, …) and assign each a stable `header` slug for answer
   mapping.
2. Emit one `askQuestions` call with the full list. The user fills the
   inline form once.
3. Persist the answers via `apex-recall decide --key <header> --value <choice>`
   for each non-skipped answer.

Batch currently known findings within each pass. New blockers, changed inputs
or a later review may require another question; never suppress a required gate
to meet a call budget. Persist per-finding actions under the canonical review
protocol, including explicit Edit rationale; unresolved must-fix findings block
in every mode, including unattended execution.

### Preflight Blocker Form

When Phase 1 preflight finds blockers (AVM schema mismatch, region
limitation, version pin conflict), surface them via a single
`askQuestions` call:

- **header**: `Preflight Blockers Found`
- **question**: 1-line summary referencing `04-preflight-check.md` for
  details (e.g. "2 AVM schema mismatches, 1 region limitation. See
  04-preflight-check.md for details.")
- **options**:
  - `Fix and re-run preflight` (recommended) — for plan-input revisions or
    module substitutions, STOP and present the Return to Step 4 human handoff
    to Planner. CodeGen must not edit plan inputs or substitute modules itself.
    Await Planner's revised, approved inputs before re-entering Phase 1.
  - `Abort — return to Planner` — STOP, present the Return to Step 4
    handoff, leave session state at Step 5 awaiting Planner rev.

Never enumerate the blockers in chat prose and ask the user to reply;
always use the form so a single-shot answer captures intent.

### Mechanical Auto-Fix Before Exiting (MANDATORY)

Before emitting the Step 5 completion handoff, run a mechanical fix pass on
the IaC tree. NEEDS_REVISION must not exit Step 5 if any MEDIUM finding is
in this set — fix them in place and re-validate:

- **LAW `dependsOn` wiring** — when a module reads from
  `logAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceId` but the module is not in `dependsOn`,
  inject the dependency. Same rule for App Insights → LAW and any
  diagnostic-settings consumer.
- **CIDR parameterization** — replace hardcoded `10.x.x.x/yy` strings in
  module bodies with parameters declared in `main.bicep` /
  `variables.tf`, defaulted to the original value so callers stay
  unchanged.
- **Missing `@description` on parameters** — add a one-line description
  derived from the parameter name.
- **Tag map / object completion** — when a tag key in the baseline (four
  defaults + governance) is missing on a resource, inject it from the
  central `tags` map / variable rather than asking the user.

These fixes are mechanical and do not change the architecture; they DO
NOT trigger a return to Planner. After applying, re-run
`bicep-validate-subagent` / `terraform-validate-subagent`. Re-run the
failing challenger pass only if any non-mechanical finding remains.

Exit-state contract: Step 5 may exit only when the validator returns
`APPROVED`, or when remaining findings are explicitly accepted via an
`apex-recall decide` override entry with `--rationale`.
