# Contract Emission & IaC Handoff (Wave 1+ / Wave 3+)

Shared CodeGen workflow for both 06b-Bicep and 06t-Terraform agents.
Defines the machine-readable contract integrity gate (Phase 1), the
validate gate (Phase 4.6), and the IaC handoff emission (Phase 6) that
replace the legacy prose `05-implementation-reference.md` as the input
to Deploy agents.

## Inputs from Step 4 (frozen)

CodeGen reads these as canonical sources of truth. Do NOT re-derive them
from `04-implementation-plan.md` prose:

| Artifact                       | Schema                                                                               | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `04-iac-contract.json`         | [`iac-contract-v0`/`v1`](../../../../tools/schemas/iac-contract.schema.json)            | Resource list, module pins, diagnostics + identity contract  |
| `04-policy-property-map.json`  | [`policy-property-map-v1`](../../../../tools/schemas/policy-property-map.schema.json)   | L1m governance attestation map (one row per Deny policy)     |
| `04-environment-manifest.json` | [`environment-manifest-v1`](../../../../tools/schemas/environment-manifest.schema.json) | Per-environment values (subscription_id, identities, alerts) |

If any contract is missing or fails its validator, STOP and traverse
`↩ Return to Step 4`. CodeGen never patches the contract.

## Step 4 — Pre-review feasibility gate

Before the first independent review and after each authorized repair, validate the complete provider constraint set,
not only the last reported finding. This is author validation, not a replacement for independent review. Keep the
existing review/repair limits; finding another mechanical defect does not renew them.

### Names and scope

- Evaluate global-name derivations for every allowed environment with the full shared suffix, separators and
  maximum project segment. Storage and Key Vault must stay within 24 characters and their service-specific character
  rules. Bound the project segment using the remaining name budget, not a hard-coded assumption that every environment
  is `dev`. Preserve the approved suffix strategy. Check the same expression in plan and contract descriptions.
- For every raw resource, record resource scope, owning module target scope and caller scope. An RG module cannot
  contain a subscription-scoped `InsightAlert`; use a separate subscription module called by the subscription root.
  Keep budget/Action Group ownership independent from anomaly scope and direct email delivery.
- Read the selected track's cost guidance before authoring the cost task. For Bicep, load
  [all anomaly hard prerequisites](../../apex-azure-defaults/references/cost-alerts-bicep.md#6-cost-anomaly-alert-subscription-scoped)
  together: subscription module/call site, display-name limit, scope-matched view ID and bounded UTC-midnight schedule.
  Terraform implementations must satisfy the same Azure provider constraints using their supported resource API.

### Monitoring access paths

For new or explicitly migrated readiness-mode contracts, mirror the approved Architecture dependency matrix into
`capability_checks` and run `validate:iac-contract -- <artifact-path> --readiness`. Each entry records its ID,
owner, required-now/security obligation, design status, consumers, dependencies, evidence references and runtime status.
Deferred entries need `approval_ref` and `revisit_condition`; security obligations cannot be deferred. A designed
entry requires dependency/evidence references but may remain runtime-unverified until authorized deployment checks.
Schema validation cannot prove evidence truth: the owning independent review verifies source and scope. Legacy
contracts without this optional map retain schema validation but cannot claim readiness-mode coverage or silently
migrate at read time. Preserve original reviewed bytes and use owner-approved successor inputs for migration.

Before freezing private Log Analytics/Application Insights settings, include the required query and ingestion paths
in the plan and resource inventory. Disabled public access does not create an AMPLS, resource association, private
endpoint, DNS configuration or client-network route. Establish ownership of existing shared monitoring connectivity
or plan the required resources and costs; preserve security defaults and get approval for scope changes.
Distinguish platform diagnostic delivery from application/agent ingestion, and required query access from an explicitly
approved deferred capability. Validate DNS-zone reuse and subnet capacity rather than adding duplicate zones.
See the [CodeGen reachability gate](codegen-shared-workflow.md#azure-monitor-reachability) and its official reference.

#### Shared-path reconciliation evidence

Approval to verify a shared path authorizes only the agreed read-only discovery, not a project-owned AMPLS,
operator-network design, extra spending or changes to frozen artifacts. Report "shared-path check completed" rather
than "resolution approved" unless the user actually approved the proposed design. If no usable path is verified,
return options to Architect, then Planner; do not turn the discovery result into automatic redesign approval.

Before calling a candidate approval-ready, reconcile the whole operator workflow, not just its network diagram:

- Adding a resource type invalidates any policy-map justification based on that type being absent from the plan.
  Re-evaluate its effective assignments and resolved parameters; an unrestricted SKU listing is not Azure Policy
  compliance. Reuse current evidence where sufficient rather than restarting all discovery.
- Verify the chosen SKU's provisioning method, operator authentication and VM login, query API/tool authentication,
  and software-installation/patching egress. List unsupported or unknown combinations as unresolved prerequisites.
  A conditional design choice may be approved, but do not call it implementation-ready until those gaps are resolved.
- Entra directory permissions and group creation gate provisioning, not drafting with explicitly unresolved identity
  inputs. Record group ownership, intended membership and assignment scopes; create groups or roles only with the
  required permission and operation authorization. Preserve a recorded budget/design decision during reconciliation.

- **Inventory coverage**: record subscription/RG scope, permissions, pagination and failed requests. Prefer a
  subscription-wide typed inventory or Resource Graph query when authorized; do not guess relevant RGs by name.
  No match means "not found within the inspected scope", not tenant-wide absence. Generic resource listings do not
  prove effective routes, DNS forwarding, peering child-resource state, client reachability or cross-subscription ownership.
  Verify any candidate path's associations, endpoint approval, DNS links/forwarders and actual client network separately.
- **Traffic evidence**: supported Azure diagnostic-setting service delivery can work without AMPLS, but this does not
  establish private-endpoint traversal, configured diagnostics or successful ingestion for this project. Verify each
  producer/destination and service exception; distinguish support from observed delivery. AMPLS requirements for
  SDK/agent ingestion and queries apply under the selected private-access posture, not to every Azure Monitor deployment.
- **Capacity**: a `/27` has 27 usable addresses, but the AMPLS minimum allocation is a lower bound, not a reservation
  or maximum. Count actual/planned endpoint IP configurations (including service subresources), existing allocations
  and growth headroom. Report assumed-fit arithmetic conditionally; do not claim verified capacity from minimums alone.
  With 27 usable addresses and at least 11 consumed, at most 16 remain, not at least 16; actual allocations decide fit.
- **Pricing**: route new estimates through `cost-estimate-subagent` under the caller's delegation/approval contract;
  otherwise return the pricing task to its owner. Do not query pricing directly or broaden to unrelated networking
  products after a failed lookup. Existing approved meter evidence may support a clearly labeled historical illustration,
  not a fresh quote. Include additional DNS zones/queries, endpoint processing and operator connectivity, with a dated
  currency conversion before comparing USD costs to EUR headroom. No identified AMPLS meter is not proof of no charge.
  Include deallocation ownership and runtime sensitivity, retained disks and applicable transactions, outbound access
  and free-tier eligibility. Show rounded decision totals with explicit assumptions, not arithmetic precision as confidence.
  Use existing notes/evidence to state each meter's actual unit and usage; never calculate per-GB or monthly charges
  as hourly rates. A documented no-charge service may be disclosed separately with its official source rather than
  repeatedly searching for a zero-price meter. Share current, identical common-meter evidence across comparisons;
  preserve per-option quantities, original timestamps and cumulative request allowances.
- **Preservation**: capture and compare full before/after hashes of the frozen input set. Timestamps and untracked
  Git status do not prove unchanged bytes. Record missing baseline evidence as unverified, not preserved.

### Scheduled-action deployment contract

For each `Microsoft.CostManagement/scheduledActions` row, populate `resources[].deployment` with its actual kind
and scope. An `InsightAlert` requires all fields below (Bicep also requires `module_scope`); the existing
`validate:iac-contract` gate rejects incomplete or invalid values in both contract revisions and IaC tracks.

```json
{
  "kind": "InsightAlert",
  "scope": "subscription",
  "module_scope": "subscription",
  "display_name_max_length": 25,
  "view_scope": "same-subscription",
  "schedule": {
    "anchor": "deployment-date",
    "start_time": "00:00:00Z",
    "end_time": "00:00:00Z",
    "max_duration_days": 365
  }
}
```

These fields are CodeGen obligations, not proof of generated code or provider acceptance. Use the same values in
the task, raw-resource exception and code-generation bindings. Derive dates at deployment, not planning; Bicep can
use a `utcNow('yyyy-MM-dd')` parameter default and `dateTimeAdd(..., 'P365D', 'yyyy-MM-dd')` with midnight suffixes.
The 365-day bound is conservative across leap years. Preserve the full subscription ID in the view resource ID.
Do not invent an `Email` kind to bypass anomaly requirements. Retain provider/version verification at CodeGen/deploy.

### Validation and review brief

Run the explicit artifact-path commands below on the finalized batch, not a bare project name. A zero-file result
does not validate a project. For related checks use the actual plan path for `validate:plan-avm-pins`, contract path
for `validate:avm-versions:freeze`, and project directory for `validate:sku-iac-coverage`.
Use `apex-recall decisions --project <project> --json` and `.session.open_findings` from `show`; do not guess aliases.
Keep terminal programs explicit (`python3 -c`, `node --input-type=module -e`); bare language snippets are not shell code.
Confirm installed diagram icon classes before writing imports; preserve embedded SVG assets and inspect rendered output.
Recipient arrays contain plain email addresses, not Markdown links.

The review brief includes these provider constraints, exact input/output paths and actual validator commands/results.
Ask the first comprehensive reviewer to examine all coupled constraints and return all substantiated findings together,
not stop at the first issue. Confirmations check prior closure plus the same complete set; a clean schema is not
semantic feasibility. Do not increase the auto-fix cap or suppress later valid findings to reduce review counts.

## Phase 1 — Contract Integrity Gate (MANDATORY)

Run before any code-generation work:

```bash
npm run validate:iac-contract -- agent-output/{project}/04-iac-contract.json
npm run validate:iac-contract-consistency -- agent-output/{project}/04-iac-contract.json
npm run validate:policy-property-map -- agent-output/{project}/04-policy-property-map.json
```

Any non-zero exit ⇒ STOP. Run `validate:environment-manifest` too if
the workload uses identity / app regs / alerts / budgets.

Cross-check module source + version pins in `modules.<tool>[]` against
the resolved AVM schema (available Bicep metadata tools or Terraform Registry
metadata for the approved exact version); pin mismatches block Phase 2.

## Phase 4.6 — Validate Gate (MANDATORY)

Run the Azure-side validate after local checks and **before** completion or handoff emission in every mode.
Optional review does not own or waive this gate. It catches some policy/template/provider errors that local lint
cannot; partial nested expansion and successful validate are not proof of successful apply.

### Bicep

```bash
az deployment sub validate \
  --location <primary-region> \
  --template-file infra/bicep/{project}/main.bicep \
  --parameters infra/bicep/{project}/main.<env>.bicepparam
```

### Terraform

The CodeGen parent runs this plan gate and records its evidence; the read-only
`terraform-validate-subagent` owns lint/review only. Backend-disabled init is
sufficient for local validation, not for planning against the configured backend.
Before this gate, verify backend existence/access and the approved backend
configuration and workspace. Do not bootstrap resources or migrate state here.
Missing prerequisites block the gate. After init, select and verify the approved
existing workspace before planning. Reinitialize on provider, lockfile, module,
or backend changes; workspace/environment changes invalidate prior plan evidence.
Reuse unchanged, verified initialization only when all those inputs remain current.

```bash
cd infra/terraform/{project}/
terraform init -input=false -lockfile=readonly && \
  terraform workspace select <approved-workspace> && \
  terraform workspace show && \
  terraform validate && \
terraform plan -refresh=false -input=false \
  -var-file=<env>/main.tfvars.json -out=tfplan
```

If init reports backend reconfiguration or migration is required, stop for the
existing approval/recovery path; never silently add migration or upgrade flags.
`-refresh=false` does not make a plan offline: providers/data sources may still
require Azure access. No access means no successful plan evidence.

Resolve environment-specific inputs through
[identity resolution](../../apex-azure-defaults/references/identity-resolution.md#resolve-before-asking) before invoking.
`validate-environment-manifest.mjs --redact` produces a redacted display, not usable deployment parameters.
Build parameters using approved process-local values and put generated output in invocation-owned scratch outside
the IaC tree. Capture parameter-build and provider-validation command, exit code and output hash separately.
An unexecuted provider command has no observed exit code; never borrow parameter-build evidence for it.

**Timeout-retry policy** (applied by the gate executor; Terraform: CodeGen parent): retry
**at most 2 times** with exponential backoff (5s, 15s) on transient
network / HTTP errors. Persistent template/provider errors are NOT
retried — they return to Phase 2.

Record `exit_code` and `stdout_sha256` in the upcoming
`05-iac-handoff.json#validation_summary.validate_gate`.

## Phase 6 — IaC Handoff Emission (MANDATORY, Wave 3+)

Emit `agent-output/{project}/05-iac-handoff.json` (schema:
[`iac-handoff-v1`](../../../../tools/schemas/iac-handoff.schema.json)). This
compact record replaces the legacy prose `05-implementation-reference.md`
as the deploy agent's input — `07b/07t` reads ONLY the handoff and
`04-environment-manifest.json`, never re-reading the plan or the IaC
tree unless `tree_hash` mismatches.

### Required fields

- `tree_hash` — sha256 of sorted file hashes over the IaC root
  (`infra/bicep/{project}/` or `infra/terraform/{project}/`).
  Computed by `validate-iac-handoff.mjs`.
  Obtain it with `node tools/scripts/validate-iac-handoff.mjs --tree-hash infra/<tool>/<project>`;
  never copy the algorithm into shell snippets. This read-only mode emits the canonical digest and file count.
- `entrypoint`:
  - Bicep: `kind: bicep-main`, path to `main.bicep`, `scope: subscription`
  - Terraform: `kind: terraform-root`, path to module dir, `scope: subscription`
- `validation_summary.verdict` — must be `APPROVED`; anything else
  blocks `complete-step`.
- `validation_summary.tool_versions` — captured `bicep --version` or
  `terraform version` + `az version`.
- `validation_summary.validate_gate` — command + exit_code + stdout
  SHA-256 from Phase 4.6.
- `governance_attestation.rows[]` — one row per L1m Deny policy
  pointing at the file + line that satisfies it. **Every L1m Deny
  policy MUST have a row.**
- `required_inputs[]` — every IaC parameter / variable whose source
  field lives in `04-environment-manifest.json`.

### Validate before complete-step

```bash
npm run validate:iac-handoff -- agent-output/{project}/05-iac-handoff.json
```

`validation_summary.verdict != APPROVED` or any handoff validator error
blocks `apex-recall complete-step <project> 5 --json`.
