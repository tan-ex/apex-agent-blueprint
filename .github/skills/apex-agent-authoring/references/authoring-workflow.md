# Authoring Workflow

## Agent Hierarchy

Top-level agents represent workflow steps or user-facing utilities. Subagents
are not user-invocable, do not chain, and return bounded structured results.
Use the workflow graph as canonical topology rather than duplicating a step table.

## Research Before Implementation

1. Locate the owning implementation, nearest analogous agent, and template.
2. Load only skills and references required by the current change.
3. Verify external contracts through documentation or a validation subagent.
4. Retrieve predecessor state and cached decisions through `apex-recall`.
5. Clarify only information that materially changes implementation.

## Subagent Delegation

1. Compile the minimum complete input set.
2. State exact activities and constraints.
3. Require a structured verdict, schema, or bounded report.
4. Integrate the result without replaying raw working context.

Pass required paths, decisions, and output contracts explicitly because
subagents do not inherit parent history.

Check explicit caller permissions and actual tool availability before dispatch.
`disable-model-invocation: true` on a target does not deny an explicit allowlist.
Handoff-only mains and leaf workers use `agents: []`; do not add an `agent` tool
merely because that empty list exists. Use human handoffs for unsupported routes.

For Sol/Terra/Luna mains, retain a concise Markdown Role, Goal, Success criteria,
Constraints, Output, and Stop rules contract plus existing workflow H2 anchors.
Removing XML wrappers must preserve their constraints and approval gates. Workers
need a role contract with inputs, activities, outputs, and failure/return rules,
not obligatory personality or main-agent headings.
