# Skills

This directory contains Agent Skills for GitHub Copilot. Skills are reusable,
domain-specific procedures and knowledge loaded according to their invocation flags.

## Skill Name Migration

Repository skills use exactly one `apex-` prefix. The migration rule is
`<previous-name>` to `apex-<previous-name>` for both the immediate directory and
its `SKILL.md` name. For example, `azure-defaults` becomes `apex-azure-defaults`
and `mermaid` becomes `apex-mermaid`.

This is a breaking name/path change: update explicit skill invocations and
repository skill paths in your own integrations. No old-name wrappers remain.
Public npm commands, instruction filenames, agent identities, and external
or user-profile skills are unchanged. Imported licenses, attribution, upstream
URLs, and provenance metadata remain intact. Discovery descriptions route to
the new installed names; natural-language trigger phrases remain unchanged.

The tracked [migration map and retention decisions](../../tools/tests/exec-plans/active/apex-workflow-audit.md#skill-merger-and-retirement-plan)
list every original and new name, provenance, and rollback boundaries. To roll
back, revert the naming commit and its consumer changes together; do not restore
only the directories. For upstream refreshes, map the original upstream skill
name to its prefixed local directory and review the diff to retain APEX adaptations.

| `apex-vendor-prompting`  | Manual vendor prompting audit | `/apex-vendor-prompting` |
| `apex-terraform-search-import` | Manual Terraform discovery/import workflow | `/apex-terraform-search-import` |

### Procedure Ownership

- [apex-unslop](apex-unslop/SKILL.md) provides manual-only prose cleanup via `/apex-unslop`.
   It preserves technical facts and file contracts; no production agent loads it as a required step.
- [apex-agent-authoring](apex-agent-authoring/SKILL.md) owns agent fleet and `.github`
   authoring assessments, plus reference-only assessment design history.
- [apex-context-management](apex-context-management/SKILL.md) owns log export, context audit,
   and runtime compression. A supplied profile can inform an authoring scorecard without moving runtime ownership.
- [apex-workflow-engine](apex-workflow-engine/SKILL.md) owns workflow entry, recovery, and DAG routing.

### Local And Agent Host

Local `.prompt.md` files are adapters; they are not Host entry points. Agent Host uses
manual skills such as `apex-host-workflow-start`, `apex-host-git-commit`, and
`apex-host-debug-log-export`. Select the required owning agent first. For recovery,
explicitly request the `resume` operation through `apex-host-workflow-start`.
Skills inherit the caller's model/tools and never grant permissions or select an agent.
Source checks do not prove runtime availability, attachment, or model eligibility.

## Usage

### Automatic Activation

Eligible skills can load when your request matches their description.
`disable-model-invocation: true` requires manual invocation; `user-invocable: false`
hides a skill from the slash menu. Defaults are `false` and `true`, respectively.
Neither flag overrides production human-selection or approval gates.

```text
"Create an architecture diagram for the ecommerce project"
→ apex-python-diagrams skill activates
```

### Explicit Invocation

Manual-only maintenance skills: `/apex-unslop`, `/apex-vendor-prompting` and
`/apex-terraform-search-import`. They are not required production-agent loads. Documentation obligations,
vendor validators and import/apply approval gates still apply. Skill metadata may remain discoverable;
manual-only does not guarantee a measured token reduction.

Reference the skill by name for explicit activation:

```text
"Use the apex-azure-adr skill to document our database decision"
```

### Via Agent Handoff

Agents can invoke skills through self-referencing handoffs:

```text
Architect agent → "▶ Generate Architecture Diagram" button
→ Uses apex-python-diagrams skill
```

## Skill vs Agent

| Aspect          | Agents                          | Skills                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Invocation**  | `Ctrl+Shift+A` manual selection | Automatic or explicit             |
| **Scope**       | Workflow steps with handoffs    | Focused, single-purpose tasks     |
| **State**       | Conversational context          | Stateless                         |
| **When to use** | Multi-step processes            | Specific document/output creation |

## Creating New Skills

Follow the structure in
[agent-skills.instructions.md](../instructions/agent-skills.instructions.md):

1. Copy an existing `SKILL.md` (e.g. `apex-azure-defaults/SKILL.md`) as a template.
2. Update the frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `compatibility`) per
   the instruction file's rules.
3. Place deep reference material under `references/` (loaded on demand).
4. Run `npm run validate:skills` and `npm run validate:agents` to verify.

Use the authoring instructions to review frontmatter quality. Required documentation updates use the applicable
file instructions; published documentation maintenance belongs to `jonathan-vella/apex-docs`.
