## 6. Provisioning Limit Checklist

**Purpose:** Validate that the selected subscription and region have sufficient quota/capacity for all resources to be deployed.

> **⚠️ REQUIRED:** This is a **TWO-PHASE** process. Complete both phases before proceeding.

### Phase 1: Prepare Resource Inventory

List all resources to be deployed with their types and quantities. Leave quota/limit columns empty.

| Resource Type       | Number to Deploy | Total After Deployment    | Limit/Quota               | Notes                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| {ARM-resource-type} | {count}          | _To be filled in Phase 2_ | _To be filled in Phase 2_ | _To be filled in Phase 2_ |

**Example format:**

| Resource Type                                       | Number to Deploy | Total After Deployment | Limit/Quota | Notes |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments                   | 1                | _TBD_                  | _TBD_       | _TBD_ |
| Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines (Standard_D4s_v3) | 3                | _TBD_                  | _TBD_       | _TBD_ |
| Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses                 | 2                | _TBD_                  | _TBD_       | _TBD_ |
| Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts               | 1                | _TBD_                  | _TBD_       | _TBD_ |
| Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts                   | 2                | _TBD_                  | _TBD_       | _TBD_ |

### Phase 2: Fetch Quotas and Validate Capacity

**Action:** **MUST invoke apex-azure-quotas skill first** to populate the remaining columns with actual quota data using Azure quota CLI. Only use fallback methods if quota CLI is not supported.

Read the canonical [quota evidence and fallback contract](../../apex-azure-quotas/references/commands.md#quota-evidence-and-fallback).
Published defaults are not observed subscription limits. Preserve live usage and the actual applicable limit,
source command/API or confirmation, collection time, scope, quota name, units and diagnostics.
Static catalogs and unrestricted SKU listings do not prove regional capacity or guarantee allocation.
Unknown or insufficient quota blocks readiness and infrastructure generation; record the missing evidence.
A blocked draft is not a validated plan.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Process **ONE resource type at a time**. Do NOT try to apply all steps to all resources at once. Complete steps 1-7 for the first resource, then move to the next resource, and so on.

For each resource type:

1. **Check if quota CLI is supported** - Run `az quota list --scope /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/{ProviderNamespace}/locations/{region}` to verify the provider is supported. If you encounter issues or need help finding the correct resource name, invoke the apex-azure-quotas skill for troubleshooting.
2. **Get current usage and limit**:
   - **If quota CLI is supported**:
     - Get limit: `az quota show --resource-name {quota-resource-name} --scope /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/{ProviderNamespace}/locations/{region}`
     - Get current usage: `az quota usage show --resource-name {quota-resource-name} --scope /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/{ProviderNamespace}/locations/{region}`
  - **If unsupported capability is confirmed** (not merely a generic `BadRequest`):
    - Get count usage: `az graph query --subscriptions "{subscription-id}" -q "resources | where type == '{resource-type}' and location == '{location}' | count"` only for a documented regional count quota. For subscription-wide limits omit the location filter. This is not a vCPU usage query.
     - Get the actual applicable subscription limit from a live service-specific source or Portal/support confirmation.
       Service documentation defines scope and units; published defaults alone leave headroom unknown.
3. **Calculate total in matching units** - For count quotas, add resource counts. For vCPU quotas, sum each VM/pool's maximum planned instance count times its SKU vCPUs (including autoscale/surge); then add current vCPU usage. Check both family and regional total vCPU quotas, with subscription, region, quota name and units recorded.
4. **Verify quota headroom** - Ensure normalized total is at most the quota. Quota headroom does not prove SKU availability or physical regional capacity; missing usage, scope, units or SKU size blocks readiness.
5. **Document evidence** - Record usage and limit provenance, collection window, normalized demand and diagnostics.
  Missing, stale or invalid usage, limit, scope, quota name, units or SKU size means unknown headroom, not zero.

**Completed example:**

| Resource Type                                       | Number to Deploy | Total After Deployment | Limit/Quota    | Notes                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments                   | 1                | 1                      | 50             | Fetched from: apex-azure-quotas (ManagedEnvironmentCount)  |
| Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines (Standard_D4s_v3) | 3 VMs = 12 vCPUs | 24 vCPUs               | 350 vCPUs      | Example: 12 existing + 3 x 4 planned; verify family AND regional totals |
| Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses                 | 2                | 5                      | 100            | Fetched from: apex-azure-quotas (PublicIPAddresses)        |
| Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts | 1 | Current count + 1 | Verified count limit | Record documented scope; omit region for subscription-wide limits |
| Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts | 2 | 8 | Unknown until observed | Published default alone blocks readiness |

**Status:** Quota sufficient | Near quota limit (>80%) | Insufficient quota | Unknown (blocked)

> **CRITICAL:** Replace "_TBD_" and "_To be filled in Phase 2_" with observed evidence or explicit unknowns.
> A blocked draft may be shown to request missing evidence, but Phase 2 cannot be marked complete and the plan
> cannot be presented as validated until quota evidence is complete. Track SKU restrictions and capacity separately.

**Notes:**

- **MUST use apex-azure-quotas skill first** to check providers via quota CLI (`az quota` commands) - Microsoft.Compute, Microsoft.Network, Microsoft.App, etc.
- Azure quota CLI is **ALWAYS preferred over REST API** for checking quotas
- **ONLY for confirmed unsupported providers**, use scope- and unit-matched fallback methods from official service limits.
  Diagnose `BadRequest`, authorization and malformed scopes before classifying capability.
- If any resource exceeds limits, obtain approval before changing region or requesting a quota increase.

## 7. Execution Checklist

### Phase 1: Planning

- [ ] Analyze workspace
- [ ] Gather requirements
- [ ] Confirm subscription and location with user
- [ ] Prepare resource inventory (Step 6 Phase 1: list resource types and deployment quantities)
- [ ] Fetch quotas and validate capacity (Step 6 Phase 2: invoke apex-azure-quotas skill to use quota CLI)
- [ ] Scan codebase
- [ ] Select recipe
- [ ] Plan architecture
- [ ] **User approved this plan**

### Phase 2: Execution

- [ ] Research components (load references, invoke skills)
- [ ] **⛔ For Azure Functions: Load composition rules** (`services/functions/templates/selection.md` → `services/functions/templates/recipes/composition.md`) and use `azd init -t <template>` — NEVER hand-write Bicep/Terraform
- [ ] For other services: Generate infrastructure files following service-specific guidance
- [ ] Apply recipes for integrations (if needed)
- [ ] Generate application configuration
- [ ] Generate Dockerfiles (if containerized)
- [ ] **⛔ Update plan status to "Ready for Validation"** — Use the `edit` tool to change the Status line in `infra/{iac}/{project}/.azure/plan.md`. This step is MANDATORY before invoking apex-azure-validate.

### Phase 3: Validation

- [ ] **PREREQUISITE:** Plan status MUST be "Ready for Validation" (Phase 2 last step)
- [ ] Invoke apex-azure-validate skill
- [ ] All validation checks pass
- [ ] Record validation proof below
- [ ] apex-azure-validate updates plan status to "Validated" only after recording proof

### Phase 4: Deployment

- [ ] Explicit deployment request and required approvals exist; validation-only stops before this phase
- [ ] Invoke apex-azure-deploy skill
- [ ] Deployment successful
- [ ] Update plan status to "Deployed"

---

## 7. Validation Proof

> **⛔ REQUIRED**: The apex-azure-validate skill MUST populate this section before setting status to `Validated`. If this section is empty and status is `Validated`, the validation was bypassed improperly.

| Check        | Command Run               | Result            | Timestamp   |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| {check-name} | {actual command executed} | ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail | {timestamp} |

**Validated by:** apex-azure-validate skill
**Validation timestamp:** {timestamp}

## 8. Files to Generate

| File                                   | Purpose                    | Status |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------ |
| `infra/{iac}/{project}/.azure/plan.md` | This plan                  | ✅     |
| `./azure.yaml`                         | AZD configuration          | ⏳     |
| `./main.bicep` or `./main.tf`          | Infrastructure entry point | ⏳     |
| `src/{component}/Dockerfile`           | Container build            | ⏳     |

## 9. Next Steps

> Current: {current phase}

1. {next action}
2. {following action}
```

---

## Instructions

1. **Create the plan first** — Fill in all sections based on analysis
2. **Complete quota validation** — Ensure Step 6 Phase 2 is completed with NO "_TBD_" entries. **MUST use apex-azure-quotas skill** as the primary method to fetch actual quota/usage data via quota CLI (`az quota` commands) for all resources. Use fallback methods ONLY when provider returns `BadRequest`.
3. **Present to user** — Show the completed plan and ask for approval. **DO NOT** present if Step 6 contains any "_TBD_" or "_To be filled in Phase 2_" entries.
4. **Update as you go** — Check off items in the execution checklist
5. **Track status** — Update the Status field at the top as you progress

The plan is the **single source of truth** for apex-azure-validate and apex-azure-deploy skills.
