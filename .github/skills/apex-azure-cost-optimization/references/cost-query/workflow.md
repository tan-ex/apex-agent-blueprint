# Cost Query Workflow

Use this workflow for cost totals, breakdowns, trends, and top spenders.

## 1. Determine scope and period

Use the narrowest scope from the
[Scope Reference](../../SKILL.md#scope-reference-shared-across-all-workflows) that answers the question.
`query_costs` defaults to month-to-date. Custom dates use `YYYY-MM-DD`, must be supplied as a
`from`/`to` pair, and cannot exceed the rolling 92-day lookback.

Supported timeframes are `MonthToDate`, `BillingMonthToDate`, `TheLastMonth`,
`TheLastBillingMonth`, `WeekToDate`, `TheCurrentMonth`, and `Custom`.

## 2. Configure the tool call

| Parameter | Contract |
|---|---|
| `metric` | `PreTaxCost` (default), `Cost`, or `AmortizedCost` |
| `granularity` | `None` (default), `Daily`, or `Monthly` |
| `groupBy` | Up to five comma-separated supported dimensions |
| `filterDimension` + `filterValues` | Supply both; values are comma-separated exact matches |
| `sortBy` | Cost column or selected grouping dimension |
| `sortDirection` | `desc` (default), `asc`, `descending`, or `ascending` |
| `top` | 1-5000 rows; default 100 |

Use [dimensions by scope](dimensions-by-scope.md) to select dimensions.
Resource- and meter-level dimensions require a subscription or resource-group
scope. Tag grouping and filtering are not supported by this MCP tool. For AKS
cluster or namespace breakdowns, use the ARM MCP `query_aks_costs` tool at
subscription scope.

## 3. Execute and interpret

Call the ARM MCP `query_costs` tool. If the operation is unavailable, use the Cost
Management Query API through the approved [fallback process](../tools-and-safety.md#tool-preference).
Preserve the response column order, currency, metric, scope, and period. Keep
different currencies separate.

Request `granularity=None` when the answer needs a total instead of summing
daily rows. For weekly comparisons, issue one bounded custom-period query per
week, with `granularity=None` and only the required grouping, rather than
locally parsing or time-bucketing a larger response.

The tool has no continuation input. If the requested data exceeds `top`, raise
`top` to at most 5000 or narrow the scope, period, or grouping. State when the
result may be incomplete.

## Error handling

| Error | Action |
|---|---|
| Unsupported timeframe, metric, dimension, or sort | Use a value exposed by the tool contract. |
| Missing `from`/`to` or filter pair | Supply both members of the pair. |
| Date outside 92 days | Narrow the period; fallback does not bypass this guardrail. |
| Throttled | Honor the retry guidance returned by the tool and reduce fan-out. |
| More than about 10 subscriptions | Ask the user to narrow scope. |

See [examples](examples.md), [parameter contract](request-body-schema.md), and
[guardrails](guardrails.md). Use [cost query errors](error-handling.md) for
tool-specific remediation.
