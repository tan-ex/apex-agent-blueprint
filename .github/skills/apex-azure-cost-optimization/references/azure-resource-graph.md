# Azure Resource Graph Queries for Cost Optimization

> **Read first**: [`.github/skills/apex-iac-common/references/azure-resource-graph-primer.md`](../../apex-iac-common/references/azure-resource-graph-primer.md) — shared "How to Query", "Key Tables", and KQL essentials. This file contains only the workload-specific query patterns below.

## Cost Optimization Query Patterns

**Required canonical query read:** Before orphan discovery, you MUST read only these named patterns in
[Orphaned Resource Patterns](../../apex-azure-resources/references/azure-resource-graph.md#orphaned-resource-patterns):

- **Unattached managed disks**
- **Unused public IP addresses**
- **Orphaned network interfaces**

Use their exact KQL, including projected fields. Do not proceed if the patterns cannot be loaded.
Do not invoke the `apex-azure-resources` skill or run its inventory workflow; return here for the cost-only queries below.
Discovery alone is not savings evidence: correlate findings with actual Cost Management data and utilization metrics.
Canonical resource-level results must preserve full `id` and `subscriptionId` for correlation;
never join costs by resource name or resource group alone. If the canonical query or a local
candidate query omits identity, stop that correlation and report the missing fields to the
query owner. Aggregated SKU/tag summaries are not resource-level savings evidence.
Continue the [cost, pricing, metrics, report, and audit procedure](detailed-workflow-steps.md#step-4-query-actual-costs).

**Resource count by SKU/tier (spot oversized resources):**

```kql
Resources
| where isnotempty(sku.name)
| summarize count() by type, tostring(sku.name)
| order by count_ desc
```

**Tag coverage for cost allocation:**

Use the tag key casing from the `tag_contract` in `04-governance-constraints.json`; `costcenter` is the APEX
greenfield default.

```kql
Resources
| extend hasCostCenter = isnotnull(tags['costcenter'])
| summarize total=count(), tagged=countif(hasCostCenter) by type
| extend coverage=round(100.0 * tagged / total, 1)
| order by total desc
```

**Find idle load balancers (no backend pools):**

```kql
Resources
| where type =~ 'microsoft.network/loadbalancers'
| where array_length(properties.backendAddressPools) == 0
| project id, subscriptionId, name, resourceGroup, location, sku=sku.name
```

**Get Advisor cost recommendations:**

```kql
AdvisorResources
| where properties.category == 'Cost'
| project name, impact=properties.impact, description=properties.shortDescription.solution
```

## Tips

- Use `=~` for case-insensitive type matching (resource types are lowercase)
- Navigate properties with `properties.fieldName`
- Use `--first N` to limit result count
- Use `--subscriptions` to scope to specific subscriptions
- Cross-reference orphaned resources with cost data from Cost Management API
