# Azure Diagnostics

> **AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE — MANDATORY COMPLIANCE**
>
> This document is the **official source** for debugging and troubleshooting Azure production issues. Follow these instructions to diagnose and resolve common Azure service problems systematically.

## Triggers

Activate this skill when user wants to:

- Debug or troubleshoot production issues
- Diagnose errors in Azure services
- Analyze application logs or metrics
- Fix image pull, cold start, or health probe issues
- Investigate why Azure resources are failing
- Find root cause of application errors
- Troubleshoot Azure Function Apps (invocation failures, timeouts, binding errors)
- Find the App Insights or Log Analytics workspace linked to a Function App
- Troubleshoot App Service issues (high CPU, deployment failures, crashes, slow responses, TLS/custom domains)
- Troubleshoot AKS clusters, nodes, pods, ingress, DNS or upgrades
- Troubleshoot Azure VM connectivity (RDP/SSH failures, NSG or firewall blocks, VM agent issues)
- Troubleshoot Event Hubs and Service Bus SDK errors (AMQP failures, lock lost, connectivity)

## Rules

1. Start with systematic diagnosis flow
2. Use AppLens (MCP) for AI-powered diagnostics when available
3. Check resource health before deep-diving into logs
4. Select appropriate troubleshooting guide based on service type
5. Document findings and attempted remediation steps
6. Diagnose only the approved scope; obtain separate approval before remediation
7. Default to read-only. Restarts, redeploys, `run-command`, credential resets, NSG changes,
   cordon/drain and node debug pods (`run-ig` with `--approve`) each need explicit approval
8. Never print secret values: list app setting names only, and never pass passwords through chat

## Prerequisites

- Confirm resource IDs, subscription, incident window and read access.
- Use available Azure CLI or MCP capabilities; unavailable telemetry is a gap,
  not a healthy result. Do not dump credentials or app settings into reports.

## Steps

Follow the [diagnostic workflow](references/infraops-remediation-playbooks.md#diagnostic-workflow-six-phases)
for discovery, health/metrics, logs, recent changes, severity classification and
reporting. That procedure owns phase order and the severity-to-priority mapping.
Load only the health checks and query templates needed for the selected service.

## Troubleshooting Guides by Service

| Service            | Common Issues                                                                                 | Reference                                              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Container Apps** | Image pull failures, cold starts, health probes, port mismatches                              | [container-apps/](references/container-apps/README.md) |
| **App Service**    | High CPU, deployment failures, crashes, slow responses, TLS/custom domains                    | [app-service/](references/app-service/README.md)       |
| **Function Apps**  | App details, invocation failures, timeouts, binding errors, cold starts, missing app settings | [functions/](references/functions/README.md)           |
| **AKS**            | Cluster access, nodes, `kube-system`, scheduling, crash loops, ingress, DNS, upgrades          | [AKS troubleshooting](references/aks/aks-troubleshooting.md) |
| **Compute (VM)**   | RDP/SSH connectivity, NSG/firewall blocks, credential resets, VM agent issues                 | [VM connectivity](references/compute/vm-troubleshooting.md) |
| **Messaging**      | Event Hubs and Service Bus SDK errors, AMQP failures, message lock, connectivity              | [Messaging troubleshooting](references/messaging/README.md) |

Route active AKS incidents, VM connectivity and messaging SDK problems to their guides above;
keep Container Apps, App Service and Function Apps diagnostics in this skill.

## Scripts

Bash and PowerShell pairs in `scripts/` gather evidence in one pass. All are read-only except `run-ig`.

| Script                        | Purpose                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aks-baseline`                | AKS provisioning state, node pools, recent activity, node readiness and `kube-system` health   |
| `pod-evidence`                | Status, describe, current and previous logs, and resource usage for unhealthy pods            |
| `run-ig`                      | Inspektor Gadget trace through a privileged node debug pod; runs only with `--approve`/`-Approve` |
| `appservice-diagnostics`      | App Service config, recent deployments, app setting names and custom domains                  |
| `containerapp-diagnostics`    | Container App revisions, registry and ingress config, and recent logs                         |
| `test-messaging-connectivity` | DNS, HTTPS and AMQP/Kafka port reachability for a Service Bus or Event Hubs namespace          |

## Quick Reference

### Common Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Inspect resource metadata (not Resource Health availability)
az resource show --ids RESOURCE_ID

# View activity log
az monitor activity-log list -g RG --max-events 20

# Container Apps logs
az containerapp logs show --name APP -g RG --follow

# Function App logs (query App Insights traces)
az monitor app-insights query --apps APP-INSIGHTS -g RG \
  --analytics-query "traces | where timestamp > ago(1h) | order by timestamp desc | take 50"
```

### AppLens (MCP Tools)

For AI-powered diagnostics, use:

```
mcp_azure-mcp_applens
  intent: "diagnose issues with <resource-name>"
  command: "diagnose"
  parameters:
    resourceId: "<resource-id>"

Provides:
- Automated issue detection
- Root cause analysis
- Remediation recommendations
```

### Azure Monitor (MCP Tools)

For querying logs and metrics:

```
mcp_azure-mcp_monitor
  intent: "query logs for <resource-name>"
  command: "logs_query"
  parameters:
    workspaceId: "<workspace-id>"
    query: "<KQL-query>"
```

See [kql-queries.md](references/kql-queries.md) for common diagnostic queries.

---

## Check Azure Resource Health

### Using MCP

```
mcp_azure-mcp_resourcehealth
  intent: "check health status of <resource-name>"
  command: "get"
  parameters:
    resourceId: "<resource-id>"
```

Metadata/provisioning state from `az resource show` is not Resource Health
availability. If the Resource Health tool is unavailable, report that check as
unavailable and continue the approved [health checks](references/infraops-health-checks.md).
