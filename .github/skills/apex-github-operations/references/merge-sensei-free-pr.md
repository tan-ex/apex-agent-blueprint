# Merge Sensei-Free PR

Routing source: [Local adapter](../../../../tools/apex-prompts/utility-prompts/merge-sensei-free-pr.prompt.md).
Apply the [operational boundary](../../apex-workflow-engine/references/operational-safety.md) before activities.
It controls owner selection, tool limits, worker permissions, state, and gates.


Prepare and open a pull request that ships the **work product** of a sensei-bearing
feature branch (skill content, scripts, tests, infra changes) while **excluding all
sensei plugin tooling and shim artifacts** that are not yet ready for `main`.

<investigate_before_answering>

- Confirm the source branch exists locally and is checked out or fetchable.
  Do not guess the branch name; if `${input:sourceBranch}` is missing, fall
  back to the active branch when it matches `feat/skills-sensei*`, otherwise
  ask.
- Use the existing `gh` CLI credentials. Do not run `gh auth` unless explicitly
  asked to troubleshoot authentication; never request secrets through chat.
- Confirm working tree is clean OR all changes are committed on the source
  branch. Refuse to proceed if uncommitted edits exist outside `agent-output/`.
  </investigate_before_answering>

<context>
- House convention: sensei is in-flight tooling pinned as a git submodule at
  `.github/skills/sensei`. The plugin itself, its bootstrap, wrappers, and
  shim outputs must not land on `main` until the plugin is upstreamed.
- Sensei coupling appears in three tiers; this prompt classifies and excludes
  Tier 1 + Tier 2 by default. See the Tier Reference below.
- Reusable in the future for any sensei-bearing branch — exclusion patterns
  are matched dynamically, not hard-coded.
- Pre-push lefthook validators (`diff-based-check`) run automatically on push;
  this prompt also runs them explicitly before push so failures surface
  during the prompt's flow, not later.
</context>

<task>
Execute the seven steps in Workflow, in order. Stop and ask before any
destructive git or `gh` operation. Produce the outputs listed in Output
Expectations.
</task>

<rules>
- Do NOT use `git push --no-verify`. Resolve validator failures inside the
  flow; if a failure cannot be resolved without leaving the exclusion
  contract, stop and ask.
- Do NOT alter files in `agent-output/`. Treat the directory as untracked
  noise.
- Do NOT modify the source branch (`${input:sourceBranch}`). All work
  happens on the new `chore/merge-{source}-to-{target}` branch.
- Always show the full Tier 1/2/3 file classification to the user and wait
  for approval before running `git rm`.
- Always require user approval before `git push` and before `gh pr create`.
  Branch creation may proceed within the approved scope. Exclusion approval
  authorizes only the classified entries or hunks, never whole-file restoration.
- Sensei coupling is detected dynamically by path patterns AND content scan
  for the literal string `sensei` (case-insensitive). Do not rely on a
  static exclusion list.
</rules>

## Tier Reference

The discovery step (Workflow §3) classifies every changed path into one tier:

| Tier   | What it is                                             | Action      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Tier 1 | Sensei plugin tooling proper (submodule, bootstrap,    | **Exclude** |
|        | sensei wrapper scripts, package.json sensei script     |             |
|        | entries, devcontainer sensei bootstrap)                |             |
| Tier 2 | Sensei work-product shims that are inert without the   | **Exclude** |
|        | plugin (trigger test files, `_audits/` reports, token- |             |
|        | budget config, audit-programme prompts)                |             |
| Tier 3 | Skill content + unrelated features (SKILL.md edits,    | **Include** |
|        | archive renames, MCP code, agent refinements)          |             |

A dedicated Sensei file is **Tier 1**. For mixed-purpose files, classify entries
or hunks: only the Sensei submodule section in `.gitmodules`, Sensei npm scripts,
and Sensei devcontainer bootstrap lines are Tier 1. Preserve other submodules,
scripts, bootstrap changes, ignore rules and unrelated user hunks in those files.

A file is **Tier 2** if it does not match Tier 1 but its diff against
`origin/${input:targetBranch}` contains the literal string `sensei`
case-insensitive AND its purpose is documented as supporting sensei
(trigger-test shims, audit-programme outputs, token-budget config). When
ambiguous, list the file under "needs human decision" and ask.

A file is **Tier 3** otherwise.

## Workflow

### 1. Pre-flight

- Run `git fetch origin ${input:targetBranch} --quiet`.
- Run `git status --short`. Confirm clean (or only `agent-output/`).
- Run `git log --oneline origin/${input:targetBranch}..${input:sourceBranch} | wc -l`
  and report commit count.
- Verify required access with the requested repository operation; on an
  authentication failure, stop without changing credentials or running `gh auth`.

### 2. Create the merge branch

- `git checkout -b ${input:mergeBranchName} ${input:sourceBranch}`
- Confirm branch creation; report current branch.

### 3. Discover and classify sensei coupling

Produce a table of every changed path vs `origin/${input:targetBranch}`,
classified by tier. Use this exact command pattern:

```bash
# Path-based Tier 1 candidates
git diff --name-only origin/${input:targetBranch}..HEAD | \
  grep -E '(^|/)sensei(/|$)|^\.gitmodules$'

# Content-based Tier 2 candidates (excluding Tier 1)
git diff --name-only origin/${input:targetBranch}..HEAD | \
  grep -vE '(^|/)sensei(/|$)|^\.gitmodules$' | \
  while read f; do
    if git diff origin/${input:targetBranch}..HEAD -- "$f" 2>/dev/null | \
       grep -qi "sensei"; then
      echo "$f"
    fi
  done
```

Also check:

- `package.json` for `audit:skills*` or any script entry whose value
  contains `sensei` → Tier 1 (the lines, not the file).
- `.devcontainer/post-create.sh` for sensei bootstrap blocks → Tier 1
  (remove only the approved blocks; preserve unrelated source-branch changes).
- `.gitignore` for negations of paths under `_audits/` → Tier 2.

### 4. Present the classification and ask for approval

Show three tables to the user:

- **Tier 1** with file paths and one-line reasons.
- **Tier 2** with file paths and one-line reasons.
- **Needs human decision** (any file the rules cannot classify
  deterministically).

Stop and ask: "Proceed with the exclusion plan? (yes / adjust / abort)".

Only proceed when the answer is `yes` or after the user has resolved
ambiguous entries.

### 5. Apply exclusions

Sequence matters; follow this order:

1. Capture the pre-exclusion diff and approved entry/hunk list. For mixed files,
  use editing tools to remove only approved Sensei entries. Parse JSON/config
  structure when selecting entries; never restore a mixed file from the target.
2. Inspect the Sensei submodule for local/untracked work and stop if any exists.
  After explicit removal approval, remove only its gitlink and working directory
  with Git's submodule-aware removal. Remove only its `.gitmodules` section;
  preserve other submodule sections and local configuration. Do not recursively
  force-delete the checkout. Delete `.gitmodules` only if empty and approved.
3. Remove other Tier 1/2 files only when the entire file is exclusively Sensei
  content and specifically approved for deletion. Mixed files require hunk edits.
4. Compare pre/post diffs and verify every unrelated hunk and submodule survives.
  Review remaining Sensei matches as candidates, not permission to delete them.
  Ambiguous matches or lost unrelated hunks require stopping and returning to §4.

### 6. Validate, commit, push

Run, in order:

```bash
npm run validate:skills
npm run lint:python
```

If any validator fails:

- If the failure is from a **legitimate** orphan reference left by the
  exclusion (e.g. another SKILL.md citing the now-removed sensei skill),
  fix it inline as part of the exclusion commit. Document the fix in the
  commit body.
- If the failure is unrelated to the exclusion, stop and report.

Commit with the message template:

```text
chore(merge): exclude sensei tooling and shim files from ${input:targetBranch}-bound diff

This commit removes all sensei-coupled files from the ${input:sourceBranch}
branch so the work can be merged into ${input:targetBranch} without
dragging in the in-flight sensei plugin or its shim artifacts.

Excluded (Tier 1):
- <list>

Excluded (Tier 2):
- <list>

Kept:
- <one-line summary of the work product>
```

**Ask the user before** `git push -u origin ${input:mergeBranchName}`.

On push, confirm all lefthook `diff-based-check` validators pass. If the
push is blocked, do not bypass; diagnose, fix, ask, repeat.

### 7. Open the PR

**Ask the user before** running `gh pr create`. Use:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --base ${input:targetBranch} \
  --head ${input:mergeBranchName} \
  --title "<title>" \
  --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
```

The PR body must include:

- A "What's included" table grouped by top-level area with file counts.
- A "What's excluded (and why)" list with Tier 1 + Tier 2 paths.
- A "Validation" section listing the validator commands that passed.
- A **merge strategy recommendation**: squash-merge (the source branch's
  intermediate commits still contain the now-excluded sensei files; only
  squash gives a clean linear history on `main`).

## Output Expectations

- A new branch `chore/merge-${input:sourceBranch}-to-${input:targetBranch}`
  pushed to `origin`.
- A single squash-recommended PR against `${input:targetBranch}`.
- Final report in chat: PR URL, file-count delta vs `${input:targetBranch}`,
  top-level area breakdown, validator results, and a final confirmation
  that approved Sensei exclusions are absent and unrelated changes are preserved.

## Quality Assurance

- [ ] No unapproved Sensei tooling remains; retained mentions have a reviewed disposition.
- [ ] The Sensei gitlink/section is absent; unrelated `.gitmodules` sections survive.
- [ ] `package.json` and `.devcontainer/post-create.sh` match
      `origin/${input:targetBranch}` (or carry only non-sensei changes).
- [ ] `npm run validate:skills` passes with 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- [ ] MCP configuration and Python lint pass when those areas change.
- [ ] Lefthook pre-push `diff-based-check` shows all validators green.
- [ ] PR body lists every excluded path and recommends squash-merge.

## Failure Modes and Recovery

| Failure                                                | Recovery                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pre-push validator catches an orphan reference         | Edit the offending file in the exclusion commit; do not bypass with `--no-verify`.                                                         |
| Discovery flags a file the user wants to keep          | Re-classify as Tier 3 manually; document the override in the commit body.                                                                  |
| GitHub authentication fails | Stop and report. Do not request tokens, alter credentials, or run `gh auth` automatically. |
| Source branch is not fetchable                         | Stop. Ask the user to push or rename the branch.                                                                                           |
| Working tree has uncommitted non-`agent-output/` edits | Stop. Ask whether to stash, commit on source branch, or abort.                                                                             |
