# Git Commit, Push & PR (CLI-only)

Local and Host share this procedure using the caller's authorized tools.
No specific agent or model selection is required by this shared Git procedure.
Entrypoint model preferences do not require runtime attestation here. This
procedure neither changes the model nor widens access.

Stage all changes **except** anything under `agent-output/`, `infra/`, or
`.github/skills/sensei/` (the sensei exclusion is lifted only when the
current branch is `feat/skills-sensei`), auto-generate a conventional
commit, push to the current branch, then ask whether to open a new PR or
update an existing one. Uses `git` and `gh` only — no MCP tools.

## Scope

- Workspace must be a git repository with `origin` configured.
- `gh` CLI must already be authenticated. Do not run `gh auth` or request secrets
  through chat; report authentication failures without switching credentials.
- Verify author identity with `git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT` and
  `git var GIT_COMMITTER_IDENT` before staging. If either fails, restore the
  user's intended dotfiles configuration; never invent an author or overwrite
  their identity with repository-local defaults.
- Git author identity and push credentials are separate. On an account mismatch,
  compare `gh api user --jq .login` with the account in Git's denial. With explicit
  user authorization, use the command-scoped GitHub CLI helper shown in Step 4;
  do not change persistent credential configuration.
- Excluded paths (always): `agent-output/`, `infra/`.
- Excluded path (conditional): `.github/skills/sensei/` — included only
  when `git branch --show-current` returns `feat/skills-sensei`.
- Never commit to `main`. Never force-push.

### Identity And Access Troubleshooting

Run this sequence only when identity or access fails, not before every healthy commit:

1. Identify the environment of the failing command: Windows, WSL and the container
  have separate paths and configuration. Confirm a file exists there before recreating it.
2. Use the author checks above and `git config --show-origin --get-regexp '^user\.(name|email)$'`
  to locate missing dotfiles configuration. Author identity does not authenticate a push.
3. Test ordinary Git access with `git ls-remote <intended-private-repository> HEAD`.
  Inspect the active credential helper and compare the denied account with the intended account;
  a successful `gh` lookup does not establish that Git uses the same credentials.
4. For dev containers, test host access before forwarded container access. After an authorized
  repair, repeat the original command without overrides and verify dotfiles persistence after rebuild.

Do not repeatedly reauthenticate without identifying the failing layer. Any account refresh or
credential-route change requires explicit authorization; preserve other accounts and never expose secrets.
A read-only lookup verifies repository access, not write permission; only the authorized push proves publication.

## Inputs

| Variable | Source                                  | Default        |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| subject  | argument-hint or generated from diff    | auto           |
| branch   | `git branch --show-current`             | current branch |
| sensei   | derived: `branch == feat/skills-sensei` | exclude sensei |
| pr_mode  | user choice (new / update / skip)       | ask            |
| pr_base  | user choice                             | `main`         |

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Compute the exclusion pathspec

Resolve the active branch and build the pathspec used by every subsequent
`git` command:

```bash
BRANCH="$(git branch --show-current)"
if [[ "$BRANCH" == "feat/skills-sensei" ]]; then
  EXCLUDES=(':!agent-output' ':!infra')
else
  EXCLUDES=(':!agent-output' ':!infra' ':!.github/skills/sensei')
fi
```

Every `git add`/`git status`/`git diff` command below uses
`-- . "${EXCLUDES[@]}"` to apply the exclusion list consistently. If the
user is on `feat/skills-sensei` the sensei skill files are eligible for
staging; on every other branch they are skipped.

### Step 1 — Inspect

Run these in parallel and show the output:

```bash
echo "$BRANCH"
git status --short -- . "${EXCLUDES[@]}"
git diff --stat HEAD -- . "${EXCLUDES[@]}"
```

Stop if:

- branch is `main` (refuse to commit).
- the scoped status is empty (working tree clean within scope).

Show a one-line note of any changes under the excluded folders so the user
knows they were intentionally skipped:

```bash
if [[ "$BRANCH" == "feat/skills-sensei" ]]; then
  git status --short -- agent-output infra
else
  git status --short -- agent-output infra .github/skills/sensei
fi
```

### Step 2 — Stage scoped files

First inspect the entire existing index with `git diff --cached --name-only`.
If excluded paths are already staged, stop and report them. Do not unstage the
user's work or commit it accidentally: pathspec exclusions on `git add` do not
remove existing index entries. After staging, recheck the full index against
the exclusions before committing.

Stage every change **outside** the excluded folders:

```bash
git add -A -- . "${EXCLUDES[@]}"
git diff --cached --stat
```

### Step 3 — Compose conventional commit (auto)

If the user passed a subject via the argument-hint, use it (wrap it in
`<type>(<scope>): <subject>` if missing the prefix).

Otherwise, read `.github/skills/apex-github-operations/references/commit-conventions.md`,
inspect the staged diff:

```bash
git diff --cached -- . ':(exclude)*.lock' ':(exclude)package-lock.json' | head -200
```

…and compose a message in this shape:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <short sentence-case subject>

- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>
```

**Do not ask for confirmation.** Commit the auto-generated message
immediately in Step 4. The user reviews the result via the commit hash +
summary table at the end and can amend if needed. The only remaining
confirmation gate is the PR decision in Step 5.

### Step 4 — Commit and push

```bash
git commit -m "<auto subject>" -m "<auto body>" &&
git push origin "$BRANCH"
```

Never join commit and push with `;`: a failed commit must prevent the push.
For an explicitly authorized account-mismatch recovery, replace only the push
command with this command-scoped helper (keep the commit-success condition):

```bash
git -c credential.helper= -c credential.helper='!gh auth git-credential' push origin "$BRANCH"
```

If a pre-commit hook fails, capture its output, summarize the error and stop. Do not retry.
If push is rejected, print the error and suggest `git pull --rebase` — do
not force-push.

Show the resulting commit hash:

```bash
git log -1 --pretty=format:'%h %s'
```

### Step 5 — PR decision

Detect any open PR for this branch:

```bash
gh pr list --head "$BRANCH" --state open --json number,url,title
```

Call `vscode/askQuestions` with one question:

- header: `pr-action`
- question: `What do you want to do with a pull request?`
- options:
  - If an existing PR was found: `Update existing PR #<number>` (recommended)
  - `Create a new PR to main`
  - `Skip — no PR right now`

Branch on the answer:

**Update existing PR** — the push in Step 4 already updated the branch.
Optionally refresh the PR body or title:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json url,title,state
# If user supplied a new title/body in their reply:
# gh pr edit <number> --title "<title>" --body "<body>"
```

Print the PR URL.

**Create a new PR** — auto-fill from the commit:

```bash
gh pr create --base main --head "$BRANCH" \
  --title "<commit subject>" \
  --body "$(git log origin/main..HEAD --pretty=format:'- %s')"
```

If `gh pr create` fails because the branch is not pushed or base is missing,
print the error verbatim. Provide the compare URL as fallback:
`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/compare/main...<branch>`.

**Skip** — print "PR step skipped." and finish.

## Output

Print this summary table at the end:

| Step         | Result                                                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Excluded     | `agent-output/`, `infra/` (+ `.github/skills/sensei/` off-branch) |
| Files staged | N files                                                           |
| Commit       | `<hash>` `<subject>`                                              |
| Push         | `origin/<branch>` — pushed                                        |
| Pull request | `<URL>` (created / updated) or `skipped`                          |

## Rules

- Never `git add` paths under `agent-output/` or `infra/`. Use the pathspec
  exclude (`':!agent-output' ':!infra'`) on every staging command.
- Always exclude `.github/skills/sensei/` **unless** the current branch is
  `feat/skills-sensei`. The exclusion is computed once in Step 0 and reused
  by every git command in the workflow.
- Never commit to `main`. Stop with a warning if the current branch is `main`.
- Never use `git push --force` or `--force-with-lease` in this procedure.
- Step 3 is **non-interactive** — the prompt auto-generates the commit
  message and commits without asking. The only remaining confirmation gate
  is the PR action in Step 5.
- Use `git` and `gh` exclusively — do not call any GitHub MCP tool.
- Do not use interactive flags (`-i`) on `mv`/`rm`/`cp` or `read -p`. Pipe
  long output (>50 lines) into a file under `tmp/` if needed.
