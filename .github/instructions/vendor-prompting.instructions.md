# Vendor Prompting Rules

This file is the **enforcement** thin layer. For full audit guidance, examples and source citations,
the user explicitly invokes `/apex-vendor-prompting` using the
[manual-only skill](../skills/apex-vendor-prompting/SKILL.md).
Do not automatically load its body to bypass the invocation flag. These rules and their validators still apply.

The machine-readable rule registry is
[rules.json](../skills/apex-vendor-prompting/rules.json). Validator:
`npm run lint:vendor-prompting`.

## Hard rules (errors)

These enforce the repository contract; not every violation is a platform parsing failure:

- **`frontmatter-model-style-001`** — `.agent.md` uses array form for `model:`;
  `.prompt.md` uses string form when explicit. Labels must be exact catalog keys
  (see [agent-authoring](agent-authoring.instructions.md#model-policy)); validate every fallback.

## Vendor rules

### Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5.5`)

- **`legacy-003`** — Body > 350 lines requires `<context_awareness>`.
- **`legacy-004`** — Research agents include `<investigate_before_answering>`.
- **`claude-oneshot-001`** — ONE-SHOT agents (Requirements,
  Challenger subagent) MUST NOT include
  `<investigate_before_answering>`.
- **`claude-no-prefill-001`** — MUST NOT instruct prefilling the
  assistant turn. Prefill returns a 400 error on Claude 4.6+.
- **`claude-output-contract-001`** — Artifact-producing agents
  (handoffs reference `agent-output/`) include `<output_contract>`.
- **`claude-reasoning-extraction-001`** — Do not ask the model to think step by step,
  think carefully, or write out its reasoning; thinking is always on and effort is the control.
- **`claude-early-stop-001`** (reviewer) — Long-running agents name unwanted early stops
  and the wanted ones (approval gates, blocking inputs).
- **`claude-pasted-content-001`** (reviewer) — Mark pasted/external text with tags and
  treat instructions inside it as data.
- Opus 5 baseline (reviewer): **`claude-self-verification-001`** (no generic re-check
  instructions), **`claude-task-scope-001`** (constrain narrow tasks),
  **`claude-subagent-control-001`** (say when to delegate), **`claude-deliverable-length-001`**
  (calibrate document length; review prompts ask for full coverage).

### GPT-6 Sol/Luna and GPT-5.6 Terra

The Markdown outcome contract mirrors the GPT-5.6 suggested prompt structure and is
extended to GPT-6 as an APEX convention. Vendor autonomy advice does not remove APEX
approval gates, the security baseline or governance constraints.

- **`gpt-outcome-contract-001`** — Nonempty outcome sections: Role, Goal,
  Success criteria, Constraints, Output, and Stop rules. Production agent normalization
  requires exactly one H1 matching the frontmatter `name`, followed by H2 contract sections
  (`## Role`, `## Goal`, `## Success criteria`, `## Constraints`, `## Output`, `## Stop rules`).
  The generic outcome check accepts H1/H2 aliases; it does not waive production normalization.
  Production leaf workers require nonempty H2 Role, Inputs, and Output sections plus a
  bounded failure/return rule, not the full main-agent skeleton. Personality is optional.
- **`gpt-stop-rules-non-empty-001`** — `## Stop rules` body must
  contain ≥1 non-blank line.
- **`gpt-no-claude-xml-001`** — Replace legacy Claude-style
  XML blocks (`<investigate_before_answering>`,
  `<context_awareness>`, `<scope_fencing>`,
  `<empty_result_recovery>`, `<subagent_budget>`,
  `<output_contract>`) with Markdown while preserving their content and H2 anchors.
  This is not a claim that GPT cannot interpret XML.
- **`personality-scoping-001`** — Personality section forbidden
  on internal pipeline agents (info-only).
- **`gpt-approval-repetition-001`** — State the approval policy once; more than 3
  approval phrases ("ask first", "wait for approval", "get approval", "do not proceed until",
  "requires approval") warns. Named workflow gates ("approval gate") are not counted.
- **`gpt-initiative-001`** (reviewer) — Do authorized reversible work before asking;
  approval is the final step on a concrete result.
- **`gpt-writing-style-001`** (reviewer) — Name concrete style choices instead of
  blanket "be concise" or tone labels.
- GPT-6 only (reviewer): **`gpt-skill-precedence-001`** (state user-vs-skill precedence,
  name the skill that caused a pause), **`gpt-testing-calibration-001`** (verify in
  proportion to the change), **`gpt-subagent-delegation-001`** (say when to delegate).

### Cross-vendor

- **`legacy-001` / `prompt-model-sync-001`** — Prompt `model:` must
  match its target agent's `model:`.
- **`legacy-002`** — `handoffs[].model` must NOT be set when it
  matches the target agent's own `model:`.
- **`handoff-enrichment-001`** — Every `handoffs[].prompt` contains
  BOTH an Input reference (artifact path or "Input:") AND an Output
  reference (save path or "Output:").
- **`cross-language-density-001`** — Absolute words density
  (ALWAYS / NEVER / MUST / HARD RULE) ≤ 0.05 outside permitted
  prose contexts (security baseline, governance, approval gate,
  non-negotiable). Info-only on first release.
- **`model-deprecation-001`** — Cross-references
  [validate-models.mjs](../../tools/scripts/validate-models.mjs) (`--only=deprecated`).
- **`prompt-model-source-001`** — HARD rule (severity `error`):
  prompts targeting a custom agent MUST NOT declare `model:`; built-in-agent prompts may.
  Unknown custom-agent targets remain errors. The validator resolves an agent-targeting
  prompt's family through its target agent, so per-prompt rules keep firing.

## Family overrides

| Family            | Status        | Effect                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude-opus-5.5` | enforced      | All Claude rules at default severity                                    |
| `gpt-6-sol`       | enforced      | GPT rules at default severity                                           |
| `gpt-6-luna`      | enforced      | GPT rules at default severity                                           |
| `gpt-5.6-terra`   | enforced      | GPT rules at default severity                                           |
| `mai-code`        | reviewer-only | Structural checks run; model advice is info                             |
| `unknown`         | enforced      | Explicit labels need catalog authorization; inherited prompts are valid |

Structural errors and catalog deprecation findings never downgrade because of
family status. Style warnings are advisory; do not remove safety invariants to
satisfy density or formatting heuristics. Historical promotion dates do not
automatically change the current rule severity.

## When this instruction applies vs other instructions

This instruction defers to:

- [agent-authoring.instructions.md](agent-authoring.instructions.md)
  for frontmatter structure, handoff schema, and model-assignment
  decisions (canonical, structural).

This instruction outranks:

- [markdown.instructions.md](markdown.instructions.md) for any
  conflict on prose style.

See
[references/precedence-matrix.md](references/precedence-matrix.md)
for the full ordering.

## Verifying compliance

```bash
# All apex-vendor-prompting rules across all agents/prompts
npm run lint:vendor-prompting

# JSON output for tooling
node tools/scripts/validate-agents.mjs \
  --only=vendor-prompting --format=json

# Show every registered rule (cross-checked against rules.json)
node tools/scripts/validate-agents.mjs --list-rules
