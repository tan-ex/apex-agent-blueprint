# APEX

## Setup Commands

```bash
# Clone the Accelerator template and open in dev container
# https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex-accelerator
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-infraops-project.git && cd my-infraops-project
code . # then: F1 → Dev Containers: Reopen in Container

npm install                              # Node.js deps (validators, linting)
npm run setup                            # Azure + GitHub OIDC/secrets/RBAC
```

> Python deps (diagrams and apex-recall) install automatically
> via the dev container's `post-create.sh`. Setup details:
> https://apexops.pro/getting-started/azure-setup/

## Build & Validation

```bash
# Full validation suite
npm run validate:all

# Individual checks (most-used)
npm run lint:md                          # Markdown linting
npm run lint:json                        # JSON/JSONC validation
npm run validate:agents                  # Agent + prompt frontmatter, model alignment
npm run validate:agent-registry          # Registry shape (file path, model, step)
npm run validate:iac-security-baseline   # TLS/HTTPS/Entra-only/no-public-blob baseline
npm run lint:safe-shell                  # No interactive shell prompts in committed snippets

# Full list → npm run | grep -E "^  (lint|validate|test):" or
# https://apexops.pro/reference/validation-reference/

# Pre-commit/pre-push hooks (installed via lefthook on `npm run prepare`)
git push                                 # Triggers diff-based-push-check.sh automatically

# IaC validation
bicep build infra/bicep/{project}/main.bicep && bicep lint infra/bicep/{project}/main.bicep
terraform fmt -check -recursive infra/terraform/ && npm run validate:terraform
```

## Code Style

Code style (CAF naming, required tags, default region, AVM-first, unique
suffix pattern) is documented in
[.github/skills/apex-azure-defaults/SKILL.md](.github/skills/apex-azure-defaults/SKILL.md).
Agents read that file as part of their mandatory skill load; this file
no longer duplicates the tables.

## Security Baseline

The non-negotiable security baseline (TLS 1.2 minimum, HTTPS-only, no public
blob, no shared key, Managed Identity, Entra-only SQL, App Service HTTP/2,
Container Registry admin disabled, MySQL/PostgreSQL SSL, no public network
access for PaaS data services except the Azure Monitor allowance below, private App Service APIs,
mandatory private DNS, no hardcoded secrets) is documented in
[.github/instructions/references/iac-policy-compliance.md](.github/instructions/references/iac-policy-compliance.md).
Log Analytics and workspace-based Application Insights may use authenticated public query/ingestion when
effective policy and approved requirements permit it. AMPLS is not required by default; private-only monitoring
requirements still apply. See the [networking baseline](.github/instructions/references/iac-security-baseline.md).
This is the source of truth for IaC validators (`validate:iac-security-baseline`)
and the Architect / IaC Planner / CodeGen agents. Always cross-check
`04-governance-constraints.md` for subscription-level Azure Policy
requirements that may add to the baseline.

## Agent Workflow

| Step | Phase        | Output                                                   | Review                                                    |

| 2    | Architecture | `02-architecture-assessment.md` + cost estimate          | comprehensive + separate cost-feasibility (both mandatory; deep is opt-in) |
| 3    | Design (opt) | `03-des-*.{py,png,md}` diagrams and ADRs                 | opt-in: 1× comprehensive on ADRs (skipped when no Step 3) |

All outputs → `agent-output/{project}/`. Source of truth:
`.github/skills/apex-workflow-engine/templates/workflow-graph.json`.
The Orchestrator drives all steps with human approval gates. The unified
05-IaC Planner feeds dual IaC tracks: Bicep (06b/07b) and Terraform (06t/07t).
Architecture also requires an independent cost-feasibility review in every mode.
Rotating multi-pass reviews are an explicit opt-in via
`decisions.review_depth = "deep"` (captured once per project by
01-Orchestrator) or via direct `10-Challenger` invocation. Reviews target
AI-generated creative decisions — not tool output (what-if/plan previews).

Production main agents, including `10-Challenger`, are human-selected entry points
with `disable-model-invocation: true`; the Orchestrator uses human handoffs only.
Unavailable reviewers require a human handoff to `10-Challenger`, never a nested
wrapper fallback. Missing/empty reviewer output permits exactly one identical-input
retry, then human escalation. Preserve current review evidence and approval gates.

Local prompt files are adapters; Agent Host uses shared skills with the caller's
model/tools and explicit selection of the owning agent. Legacy discovery settings
are not a security boundary. Model labels do not establish runtime cost-tier
eligibility or API support. Runtime rules and canonical review procedure:
[Copilot instructions](.github/copilot-instructions.md#harness-and-runtime-boundaries).

The E2E launch subsystem is retired. Production lesson collection, historical
lesson/schema compatibility, and existing evidence remain supported; historical
`e2e` values do not authorize a runnable workflow or automatic approval.

**Mandatory challenger reviews are enforced at runtime, not just at commit.**
`apex-recall complete-step` refuses to mark Steps 1, 2, 3.5, or 4 as complete
when the gating artifact exists but the matching `challenge-findings-*.json`
sidecar is missing (exit code 2). Both `complete-step` and `transition --complete` also reject
present reviews with unresolved must-fix findings, mismatched artifact/lens, or failed strict freshness validation,
before any state mutation. This requires Node and the workspace review validator; unavailable validation fails closed.
An accepted decision is not verified closure. Invalid present evidence cannot use a missing-review bypass.
For a separately authorized later Governance review, `complete-step` and `transition --complete` accept
`--governance-review <path>` with `--governance-review-reason "<reason>"`. Selection is explicit, Step 3.5-only,
strictly validated and logged with its byte hash; earlier reviews remain untouched. No latest-file inference,
review-budget reset or human approval is implied. The selected review cannot use the missing-review bypass.
Step 4 default-mode comprehensive confirmations use `--plan-review <path>` and `--plan-review-reason "<reason>"`
under the same strict checks and audit rules. The original Plan review stays intact. This option cannot replace
deep-review lenses, combine with a Governance selector or waive any approval/review requirement.
New selections are persisted as structured `review-selection-v1` records and revalidated by completion and
`apex-recall show`; legacy audit prose is not automatically migrated. Unchanged repeat completion preserves timestamps.
State writers reject revision conflicts. Index failure after commit returns `committed_but_index_stale` with the
committed hash; explicitly reindex instead of repeating the mutation. Normal reads never restore backups; use the
owner-authorized `recover-state` command. Compatibility, attempt accounting and exact view fields:
[`show-schema.md`](tools/apex-recall/docs/show-schema.md).
An intentional missing-review bypass requires
`--allow-missing-challenger --challenger-skip-reason "<text>"`, which
persists an audit entry in `decisions.challenger_skip[]`. A CI/commit
fallback (`npm run validate:challenger-presence`, also wired into the
lefthook `artifact-validation` hook) checks presence if session state was edited by hand;
it does not replace the runtime validity gate or independent approval checks.

Artifact lint is enforced by the lefthook `artifact-validation` pre-commit
hook and the `10-Challenger` review — agents do not call
`lint:artifact-templates` or `markdownlint-cli2` directly against
`agent-output/**` (see
[`.github/instructions/agent-authoring.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/agent-authoring.instructions.md#no-direct-markdownlint-on-agent-output-rule)).

`sku-manifest.{json,md}` is created at Step 1 (user pins only — empty
`services[]` is the common case) and mutated through Step 7: Step 2
authoring, Step 3.5 read-only findings, Step 4 reconciliation +
`requires[]` cross-check, Step 6 substitution on quota/region conflict
(via the block-with-escalation pattern), Step 7 bidirectional drift
detection. Authoring rules:
[`.github/instructions/sku-manifest.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/sku-manifest.instructions.md).

## Conventions Detail

For deeper guidance, agents read these on demand:

- Bicep conventions: `infra/bicep/AGENTS.md`
- Terraform conventions: `infra/terraform/AGENTS.md`
- azd multi-project rules: `.github/instructions/azure-yaml.instructions.md` (auto-loaded for `azure.yaml`)
- Terminal hygiene (no `mv -i`/`rm -i`/`read -p`, pipe long output to file):
  `.github/instructions/no-interactive-shell.instructions.md` (enforced by `lint:safe-shell`)
- Azure defaults: `.github/skills/apex-azure-defaults/SKILL.md`
- Workflow DAG: `.github/skills/apex-workflow-engine/templates/workflow-graph.json`
